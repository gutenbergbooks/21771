      She was certainly a singular girl, and if he felt at the end that he did
      n&rsquo;t know her nor understand her, it is not surprising that he should have
      felt it at the beginning. But he felt at the beginning what he did not
      feel at the end, that her singularity took the form of a charm which&mdash;once
      circumstances had made them so intimate&mdash;it was impossible to resist
      or conjure away. He had a strange impression (it amounted at times to a
      positive distress, and shot through the sense of pleasure&mdash;morally
      speaking&mdash;with the acuteness of a sudden twinge of neuralgia) that it
      would be better for each of them that they should break off short and
      never see each other again. In later years he called this feeling a
      foreboding, and remembered two or three occasions when he had been on the
      point of expressing it to Georgina. Of course, in fact, he never expressed
      it; there were plenty of good reasons for that. Happy love is not disposed
      to assume disagreeable duties, and Raymond Benyon&rsquo;s love was happy, in
      spite of grave presentiments, in spite of the singularity of his mistress
      and the insufferable rudeness of her parents. She was a tall, fair girl,
      with a beautiful cold eye and a smile of which the perfect sweetness,
      proceeding from the lips, was full of compensation; she had auburn hair of
      a hue that could be qualified as nothing less than gorgeous, and she
      seemed to move through life with a stately grace, as she would have walked
      through an old-fashioned minuet. Gentlemen connected with the navy have
      the advantage of seeing many types of women; they are able to compare the
      ladies of New York with those of Valparaiso, and those of Halifax with
      those of the Cape of Good Hope. Eaymond Benyon had had these advantages,
      and being very fond of women he had learnt his lesson; he was in a
      position to appreciate Georgina Gressie&rsquo;s fine points. She looked like a
      duchess,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean that in foreign ports Benyon had associated
      with duchesses,&mdash;and she took everything so seriously. That was
      flattering for the young man, who was only a lieutenant, detailed for duty
      at the Brooklyn navy-yard, without a penny in the world but his pay, with
      a set of plain, numerous, seafaring, God-fearing relations in New
      Hampshire, a considerable appearance of talent, a feverish, disguised
      ambition, and a slight impediment in his speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a spare, tough young man, his dark hair was straight and fine, and
      his face, a trifle pale, was smooth and carefully drawn. He stammered a
      little, blushing when he did so, at long intervals. I scarcely know how he
      appeared on shipboard, but on shore, in his civilian&rsquo;s garb, which was of
      the neatest, he had as little as possible an aroma of winds and waves. He
      was neither salt nor brown, nor red, nor particularly &ldquo;hearty.&rdquo; He never
      twitched up his trousers, nor, so far as one could see, did he, with his
      modest, attentive manner, carry himself as one accustomed to command. Of
      course, as a subaltern, he had more to do in the way of obeying. He looked
      as if he followed some sedentary calling, and was, indeed, supposed to be
      decidedly intellectual. He was a lamb with women, to whose charms he was,
      as I have hinted, susceptible; but with men he was different, and, I
      believe, as much of a wolf as was necessary. He had a manner of adoring
      the handsome, insolent queen of his affections (I will explain in a moment
      why I call her insolent); indeed, he looked up to her literally as well as
      sentimentally; for she was the least bit the taller of the two. He had met
      her the summer before, on the piazza of a hotel at Fort Hamilton, to
      which, with a brother officer, in a dusty buggy, he had driven over from
      Brooklyn to spend a tremendously hot Sunday,&mdash;the kind of day when
      the navy-yard was loathsome; and the acquaintance had been renewed by his
      calling in Twelfth Street on New-Year&rsquo;s Day,&mdash;a considerable time to
      wait for a pretext, but which proved the impression had not been
      transitory. The acquaintance ripened, thanks to a zealous cultivation (on
      his part) of occasions which Providence, it must be confessed, placed at
      his disposal none too liberally; so that now Georgina took up all his
      thoughts and a considerable part of his time. He was in love with her,
      beyond a doubt; but he could not flatter himself that she was in love with
      him, though she appeared willing (what was so strange) to quarrel with her
      family about him. He did n&rsquo;t see how she could really care for him,&mdash;she
      seemed marked out by nature for so much greater a fortune; and he used to
      say to her, &ldquo;Ah, you don&rsquo;t&mdash;there&rsquo;s no use talking, you don&rsquo;t&mdash;really
      care for me at all!&rdquo; To which she answered, &ldquo;Really? You are very
      particular. It seems to me it&rsquo;s real enough if I let you touch one of my
      fingertips! &ldquo;That was one of her ways of being insolent Another was simply
      her manner of looking at him, or at other people (when they spoke to her),
      with her hard, divine blue eye,&mdash;looking quietly, amusedly, with the
      air of considering (wholly from her own point of view) what they might
      have said, and then turning her head or her back, while, without taking
      the trouble to answer them, she broke into a short, liquid, irrelevant
      laugh. This may seem to contradict what I said just now about her taking
      the young lieutenant in the navy seriously. What I mean is that she
      appeared to take him more seriously than she took anything else. She said
      to him once, &ldquo;At any rate you have the merit of not being a shop-keeper;&rdquo;
       and it was by this epithet she was pleased to designate most of the young
      men who at that time flourished in the best society of New York. Even if
      she had rather a free way of expressing general indifference, a young lady
      is supposed to be serious enough when she consents to marry you. For the
      rest, as regards a certain haughtiness that might be observed in Geoigina
      Gressie, my story will probably throw sufficient light upon it She
      remarked to Benyon once that it was none of his business why she liked
      him, but that, to please herself, she did n&rsquo;t mind telling him she thought
      the great Napoleon, before he was celebrated, before he had command of the
      army of Italy, must have looked something like him; and she sketched in a
      few words the sort of figure she imagined the incipient Bonaparte to have
      been,&mdash;short, lean, pale, poor, intellectual, and with a tremendous
      future under his hat Benyon asked himself whether <i>he</i> had a
      tremendous future, and what in the world Geoigina expected of him in the
      coming years. He was flattered at the comparison, he was ambitious enough
      not to be frightened at it, and he guessed that she perceived a certain
      analogy between herself and the Empress Josephine. She would make a very
      good empress. That was true; Georgina was remarkably imperial. This may
      not at first seem to make it more clear why she should take into her favor
      an aspirant who, on the face of the matter, was not original, and whose
      Corsica was a flat New England seaport; but it afterward became plain that
      he owed his brief happiness&mdash;it was very brief&mdash;to her father&rsquo;s
      opposition; her father&rsquo;s and her mother&rsquo;s, and even her uncles&rsquo; and her
      aunts&rsquo;. In those days, in New York, the different members of a family took
      an interest in its alliances, and the house of Gressie looked askance at
      an engagement between the most beautiful of its daughters and a young man
      who was not in a paying business. Georgina declared that they were
      meddlesome and vulgar,&mdash;she could sacrifice her own people, in that
      way, without a scruple,&mdash;and Benyon&rsquo;s position improved from the
      moment that Mr. Gressie&mdash;ill-advised Mr. Gressie&mdash;ordered the
      girl to have nothing to do with him. Georgina was imperial in this&mdash;that
      she wouldn&rsquo;t put up with an order. When, in the house in Twelfth Street,
      it began to be talked about that she had better be sent to Europe with
      some eligible friend, Mrs. Portico, for instance, who was always planning
      to go, and who wanted as a companion some young mind, fresh from manuals
      and extracts, to serve as a fountain of history and geography,&mdash;when
      this scheme for getting Georgina out of the way began to be aired, she
      immediately said to Raymond Benyon, &ldquo;Oh, yes, I &lsquo;ll marry you!&rdquo; She said
      it in such an off-hand way that, deeply as he desired her, he was almost
      tempted to answer, &ldquo;But, my dear, have you really thought about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This little drama went on, in New York, in the ancient days, when Twelfth
      Street had but lately ceased to be suburban, when the squares had wooden
      palings, which were not often painted; when there were poplars in
      important thoroughfares and pigs in the lateral ways; when the theatres
      were miles distant from Madison Square, and the battered rotunda of Castle
      Garden echoed with expensive vocal music; when &ldquo;the park&rdquo; meant the
      grass-plats of the city hall, and the Bloomingdale road was an eligible
      drive; when Hoboken, of a summer afternoon, was a genteel resort, and the
      handsomest house in town was on the corner of the Fifth Avenue and
      Fifteenth Street. This will strike the modern reader, I fear, as rather a
      primitive epoch; but I am not sure that the strength of human passions is
      in proportion to the elongation of a city. Several of them, at any rate,
      the most robust and most familiar,&mdash;love, ambition, jealousy,
      resentment, greed,&mdash;subsisted in considerable force in the little
      circle at which we have glanced, where a view by no means favorable was
      taken of Raymond Benyon&rsquo;s attentions to Miss Gressie. Unanimity was a
      family trait among these people (Georgina was an exception), especially in
      regard to the important concerns of life, such as marriages and closing
      scenes. The Gressies hung together; they were accustomed to do well for
      themselves and for each other. They did everything well: got themselves
      born well (they thought it excellent to be born a Gressie), lived well,
      married well, died well, and managed to be well spoken of afterward. In
      deference to this last-mentioned habit, I must be careful what I say of
      them. They took an interest in each other&rsquo;s concerns, an interest that
      could never be regarded as of a meddlesome nature, inasmuch as they all
      thought alike about all their affairs, and interference took the happy
      form of congratulation and encouragement. These affairs were invariably
      lucky, and, as a general thing, no Gressie had anything to do but feel
      that another Gressie had been almost as shrewd and decided as he himself
      would have been. The great exception to that, as I have said, was this
      case of Georgina, who struck such a false note, a note that startled them
      all, when she told her father that she should like to unite herself to a
      young man engaged in the least paying business that any Gressie had ever
      heard of. Her two sisters had married into the most flourishing firms, and
      it was not to be thought of that&mdash;with twenty cousins growing up
      around her&mdash;she should put down the standard of success. Her mother
      had told her a fortnight before this that she must request Mr. Benyon to
      cease coming to the house; for hitherto his suit had been of the most
      public and resolute character. He had been conveyed up town from the
      Brooklyn ferry, in the &ldquo;stage,&rdquo; on certain evenings, had asked for Miss
      Georgina at the door of the house in Twelfth Street, and had sat with her
      in the front parlor if her parents happened to occupy the back, or in the
      back if the family had disposed itself in the front. Georgina, in her way,
      was a dutiful girl, and she immediately repeated her mother&rsquo;s admonition
      to Beuyon. He was not surprised, for though he was aware that he had not,
      as yet, a great knowledge of society, he flattered himself he could tell
      when&mdash;and where&mdash;a young man was not wanted. There were houses
      in Brooklyn where such an animal was much appreciated, and there the signs
      were quite different They had been discouraging&mdash;except on Georgina&rsquo;s
      pail&mdash;from the first of his calling in Twelfth Street Mr. and Mrs.
      Gressie used to look at each other in silence when he came in, and indulge
      in strange, perpendicular salutations, without any shaking of hands.
      People did that at Portsmouth, N.H., when they were glad to see you; but
      in New York there was more luxuriance, and gesture had a different value.
      He had never, in Twelfth Street, been asked to &ldquo;take anything,&rdquo; though the
      house had a delightful suggestion, a positive aroma, of sideboards,&mdash;as
      if there were mahogany &ldquo;cellarettes&rdquo; under every table. The old people,
      moreover, had repeatedly expressed surprise at the quantity of leisure
      that officers in the navy seemed to enjoy. The only way in which they had
      not made themselves offensive was by always remaining in the other room;
      though at times even this detachment, to which he owed some delightful
      moments, presented itself to Benyon as a form of disapprobation. Of
      course, after Mrs. Gressie&rsquo;s message, his visits were practically at an
      end; he would n&rsquo;t give the girl up, but he would n&rsquo;t be beholden to her
      father for the opportunity to converse with her. Nothing was left for the
      tender couple&mdash;there was a curious mutual mistrust in their
      tenderness&mdash;but to meet in the squares, or in the topmost streets, or
      in the sidemost avenues, on the afternoons of spring. It was especially
      during this phase of their relations that Georgina struck Benyon as
      imperial Her whole person seemed to exhale a tranquil, happy consciousness
      of having broken a law. She never told him how she arranged the matter at
      home, how she found it possible always to keep the appointments (to meet
      him out of the house) that she so boldly made, in what degree she
      dissimulated to her parents, and how much, in regard to their continued
      acquaintance, the old people suspected and accepted. If Mr. and Mrs.
      Gressie had forbidden him the house, it was not, apparently, because they
      wished her to walk with him in the Tenth Avenue or to sit at his side
      under the blossoming lilacs in Stuyvesant Square. He didn&rsquo;t believe that
      she told lies in Twelfth Street; he thought she was too imperial to lie;
      and he wondered what she said to her mother when, at the end of nearly a
      whole afternoon of vague peregrination with her lover, this bridling,
      bristling matron asked her where she had been. Georgina was capable of
      simply telling the truth; and yet if she simply told the truth, it was a
      wonder that she had not been simply packed off to Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benyon&rsquo;s ignorance of her pretexts is a proof that this rather oddly-mated
      couple never arrived at perfect intimacy,&mdash;in spite of a fact which
      remains to be related. He thought of this afterwards, and thought how
      strange it was that he had not felt more at liberty to ask her what she
      did for him, and how she did it, and how much she suffered for him. She
      would probably not have admitted that she suffered at all, and she had no
      wish to pose for a martyr. Benyon remembered this, as I say, in the after
      years, when he tried to explain to himself certain things which simply
      puzzled him; it came back to him with the vision, already faded, of shabby
      cross-streets, straggling toward rivers, with red sunsets, seen through a
      haze of dust, at the end; a vista through which the figures of a young man
      and a girl slowly receded and disappeared,&mdash;strolling side by side,
      with the relaxed pace of desultory talk, but more closely linked as they
      passed into the distance, linked by its at last appearing safe to them&mdash;in
      the Tenth Avenue&mdash;that the young lady should take his arm. They were
      always approaching that inferior thoroughfare; but he could scarcely have
      told you, in those days, what else they were approaching. He had nothing
      in the world but his pay, and he felt that this was rather a &ldquo;mean&rdquo; income
      to offer Miss Gressie. Therefore he did n&rsquo;t put it forward; what he
      offered, instead, was the expression&mdash;crude often, and almost
      boyishly extravagant&mdash;of a delighted admiration of her beauty, the
      tenderest tones of his voice, the softest assurances of his eye and the
      most insinuating pressure of her hand at those moments when she consented
      to place it in his arm. All this was an eloquence which, if necessary,
      might have been condensed into a single sentence; but those few words were
      scarcely needful, when it was as plain that he expected&mdash;in general&mdash;she
      would marry him, as it was indefinite that he counted upon her for living
      on a few hundreds a year. If she had been a different girl he might have
      asked her to wait,&mdash;might have talked to her of the coming of better
      days, of his prospective promotion, of its being wiser, perhaps, that he
      should leave the navy and look about for a more lucrative career. With
      Georgina it was difficult to go into such questions; she had no taste
      whatever for detail. She was delightful as a woman to love, because when a
      young man is in love he discovers that; but she could not be called
      helpful, for she never suggested anything. That is, she never had done so
      till the day she really proposed&mdash;for that was the form it took&mdash;to
      become his wife without more delay. &ldquo;Oh, yes, I will marry you;&rdquo; these
      words, which I quoted a little way back, were not so much the answer to
      something he had said at the moment, as the light conclusion of a report
      she had just made, for the first time, of her actual situation in her
      father&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I shall have to see less of you,&rdquo; she had begun by saying.
      &ldquo;They watch me so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very little already,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;What is once or twice a week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy for you to say. You are your own master, but you don&rsquo;t know
      what I go through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they make it very bad for you, dearest? Do they make scenes?&rdquo; Benyon
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not. Don&rsquo;t you know us enough to know how we behave? No
      scenes,&mdash;that would be a relief. However, I never make them myself,
      and I never will&mdash;that&rsquo;s one comfort for you, for the future, if you
      want to know. Father and mother keep very quiet, looking at me as if I
      were one of the lost, with hard, screwing eyes, like gimlets. To me they
      scarcely say anything, but they talk it all over with each other, and try
      and decide what is to be done. It&rsquo;s my belief that father has written to
      the people in Washington&mdash;what do you call it! the Department&mdash;to
      have you moved away from Brooklyn,&mdash;to have you sent to sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that won&rsquo;t do much good. They want me in Brooklyn, they don&rsquo;t
      want me at sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they are capable of going to Europe for a year, on purpose to take
      me,&rdquo; Geoigina said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can they take you, if you won&rsquo;t go? And if you should go, what good
      would it do, if you were only to find me here when you came back, just the
      same as you left me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well!&rdquo; said Georgina, with her lovely smile, &ldquo;of course they think
      that absence would cure me of&mdash;cure me of&mdash;&rdquo; And she paused,
      with a certain natural modesty, not saying exactly of what.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cure you of what, darling? Say it, please say it,&rdquo; the young man
      murmured, drawing her hand surreptitiously into his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of my absurd infatuation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And would it, dearest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very likely. But I don&rsquo;t mean to try. I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go to Europe,&mdash;not
      when I don&rsquo;t want to. But it&rsquo;s better I should see less of you,&mdash;even
      that I should appear&mdash;a little&mdash;to give you up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little? What do you call a little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Georgina said nothing, for a moment. &ldquo;Well, that, for instance, you should
      n&rsquo;t hold my hand quite so tight!&rdquo; And she disengaged this conscious member
      from the pressure of his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good will that do?&rdquo; Benyon asked,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will make them think it &lsquo;s all over,&mdash;that we have agreed to
      part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as we have done nothing of the kind, how will that help us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had stopped at the crossing of a street; a heavy dray was lumbering
      slowly past them. Georgina, as she stood there, turned her face to her
      lover, and rested her eyes for some moments on his own. At last: &ldquo;Nothing
      will help us; I don&rsquo;t think we are very happy,&rdquo; she answered, while her
      strange, ironical, inconsequent smile played about her beautiful lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how you see things. I thought you were going to say
      you would marry me!&rdquo; Benyon rejoined, standing there still, though the
      dray had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I will marry you!&rdquo; And she moved away, across the street. That
      was the manner in which she had said it, and it was very characteristic of
      her. When he saw that she really meant it, he wished they were somewhere
      else,&mdash;he hardly knew where the proper place would be,&mdash;so that
      he might take her in his arms. Nevertheless, before they separated that
      day he had said to her he hoped she remembered they would be very poor,
      reminding her how great a change she would find it She answered that she
      should n&rsquo;t mind, and presently she said that if this was all that
      prevented them the sooner they were married the better. The next time he
      saw her she was quite of the same opinion; but he found, to his surprise,
      it was now her conviction that she had better not leave her father&rsquo;s
      house. The ceremony should take place secretly, of course; but they would
      wait awhile to let their union be known.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good will it do us, then?&rdquo; Raymond Benyon asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgina colored. &ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t know, I can&rsquo;t tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then it seemed to him that he did know. Yet, at the same time, he could
      not see why, once the knot was tied, secrecy should be required. When he
      asked what special event they were to wait for, and what should give them
      the signal to appear as man and wife, she answered that her parents would
      probably forgive her, if they were to discover, not too abruptly, after
      six months, that she had taken the great step. Benyon supposed that she
      had ceased to care whether they forgave her or not; but he had already
      perceived that women are full of inconsistencies. He had believed her
      capable of marrying him out of bravado, but the pleasure of defiance was
      absent if the marriage was kept to themselves. Now, too, it appeared that
      she was not especially anxious to defy,&mdash;she was disposed rather to
      manage, to cultivate opportunities and reap the fruits of a waiting game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave it to me. Leave it to me. You are only a blundering man,&rdquo; Georgina
      said. &ldquo;I shall know much better than you the right moment for saying,
      &lsquo;Well, you may as well make the best of it, because we have already done
      it!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That might very well be, but Benyon did n&rsquo;t quite understand, and he was
      awkwardly anxious (for a lover) till it came over him afresh that there
      was one thing at any rate in his favor, which was simply that the
      loveliest girl he had ever seen was ready to throw herself into his arms.
      When he said to her, &ldquo;There is one thing I hate in this plan of yours,&mdash;that,
      for ever so few weeks, so few days, your father should support my wife,&rdquo;&mdash;when
      he made this homely remark, with a little flush of sincerity in his face,
      she gave him a specimen of that unanswerable laugh of hers, and declared
      that it would serve Mr. Gressie right for being so barbarous and so
      horrid. It was Benyon&rsquo;s view that from the moment she disobeyed her
      father, she ought to cease to avail herself of his protection; but I am
      bound to add that he was not particularly surprised at finding this a kind
      of honor in which her feminine nature was little versed. To make her his
      wife first&mdash;at the earliest moment&mdash;whenever she would, and
      trust to fortune, and the new influence he should have, to give him, as
      soon thereafter as possible, complete possession of her,&mdash;this rather
      promptly presented itself to the young man as the course most worthy of a
      person of spirit. He would be only a pedant who would take nothing because
      he could not get everything at once. They wandered further than usual this
      afternoon, and the dusk was thick by the time he brought her back to her
      father&rsquo;s door. It was not his habit to como so near it, but to-day they
      had so much to talk about that he actually stood with her for ten minutes
      at the foot of the steps. He was keeping her hand in his, and she let it
      rest there while she said,&mdash;by way of a remark that should sum up all
      their reasons and reconcile their differences,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one great thing it will do, you know; it will make me safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safe from what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From marrying any one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my girl, if you were to do that&mdash;!&rdquo; Benyon exclaimed; but he did
      n&rsquo;t mention the other branch of the contingency. Instead of this, he
      looked up at the blind face of the house&mdash;there were only dim lights
      in two or three windows, and no apparent eyes&mdash;and up and down the
      empty street, vague in the friendly twilight; after which he drew Georgina
      Gressie to his breast and gave her a long, passionate kiss. Yes,
      decidedly, he felt, they had better be married. She had run quickly up the
      steps, and while she stood there, with her hand on the bell, she almost
      hissed at him, under her breath, &ldquo;Go away, go away; Amanda&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo;
       Amanda was the parlor-maid, and it was in those terms that the Twelfth
      Street Juliet dismissed her Brooklyn Romeo. As he wandered back into the
      Fifth Avenue, where the evening air was conscious of a vernal fragrance
      from the shrubs in the little precinct of the pretty Gothic church
      ornamenting that charming part of the street, he was too absorbed in the
      impression of the delightful contact from which the girl had violently
      released herself to reflect that the great reason she had mentioned a
      moment before was a reason for their marrying, of course, but not in the
      least a reason for their not making it public. But, as I said in the
      opening lines of this chapter, if he did not understand his mistress&rsquo;s
      motives at the end, he cannot be expected to have understood them at the
      beginning.

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Portico, as we know, was always talking about going to Europe; but
      she had not yet&mdash;I mean a year after the incident I have just related&mdash;put
      her hand upon a youthful cicerone. Petticoats, of course, were required;
      it was necessary that her companion should be of the sex which sinks most
      naturally upon benches, in galleries and cathredrals, and pauses most
      frequently upon staircases that ascend to celebrated views. She was a
      widow, with a good fortune and several sons, all of whom were in Wall
      Street, and none of them capable of the relaxed pace at which she expected
      to take her foreign tour. They were all in a state of tension. They went
      through life standing. She was a short, broad, high-colored woman, with a
      loud voice, and superabundant black hair, arranged in a way peculiar to
      herself,&mdash;with so many combs and bands that it had the appearance of
      a national coiffure. There was an impression in New York, about 1845, that
      the style was Danish; some one had said something about having seen it in
      Schleswig-Holstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Portico had a bold, humorous, slightly flamboyant look; people who
      saw her for the first time received an impression that her late husband
      had married the daughter of a barkeeper or the proprietress of a
      menageria. Her high, hoarse, good-natured voice seemed to connect her in
      some way with public life; it was not pretty enough to suggest that she
      might have been an actress. These ideas quickly passed away, however, even
      if you were not sufficiently initiated to know&mdash;as all the Grossies,
      for instance, knew so well&mdash;that her origin, so far from being
      enveloped in mystery, was almost the sort of thing she might have boasted
      of. But in spite of the high pitch of her appearance, she didn&rsquo;t boast of
      anything; she was a genial, easy, comical, irreverent person, with a large
      charity, a democratic, fraternizing turn of mind, and a contempt for many
      worldly standards, which she expressed not in the least in general axioms
      (for she had a mortal horror of philosophy), but in violent ejaculations
      on particular occasions. She had not a grain of moral timidity, and she
      fronted a delicate social problem as sturdily as she would have barred the
      way of a gentleman she might have met in her vestibule with the
      plate-chest The only thing which prevented her being a bore in orthodox
      circles was that she was incapable of discussion. She never lost her
      temper, but she lost her vocabulary, and ended quietly by praying that
      Heaven would give her an opportunity to <i>show</i> what she believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was an old friend of Mr. and Mrs. Gressie, who esteemed her for the
      antiquity of her lineage and the frequency of her subscriptions, and to
      whom she rendered the service of making them feel liberal,&mdash;like
      people too sure of their own position to be frightened. She was their
      indulgence, their dissipation, their point of contact with dangerous
      heresies; so long as they continued to see her they could not be accused
      of being narrow-minded,&mdash;a matter as to which they were perhaps
      vaguely conscious of the necessity of taking their precautions. Mrs.
      Portico never asked herself whether she liked the Gressies; she had no
      disposition for morbid analysis, she accepted transmitted associations,
      and she found, somehow, that her acquaintance with these people helped her
      to relieve herself. She was always making scenes in their drawing-room,
      scenes half indignant, half jocose, like all her manifestations, to which
      it must be confessed that they adapted themselves beautifully. They never
      &ldquo;met&rdquo; her in the language of controversy; but always collected to watch
      her, with smiles and comfortable platitudes, as if they envied her
      superior richness of temperament She took an interest in Georgina, who
      seemed to her different from the others, with suggestions about her of
      being likely not to marry so unrefreshingly as her sisters had done, and
      of a high, bold standard of duty. Her sisters had married from duty, but
      Mrs. Portico would rather have chopped off one of her large, plump hands
      than behave herself so well as that She had, in her daughterless
      condition, a certain ideal of a girl that should be beautiful and
      romantic, with lustrous eyes, and a little persecuted, so that she, Mrs.
      Portico, might get her out of her troubles. She looked to Georgina, to a
      considerable degree, to gratify her in this way; but she had really never
      understood Geoigina at all She ought to have been shrewd, but she lacked
      this refinement, and she never understood anything until after many
      disappointments and vexations. It was difficult to startle her, but she
      was much startled by a communication that this young lady made her one
      fine spring morning. With her florid appearance and her speculative mind,
      she was probably the most innocent woman in New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgina came very early,&mdash;earlier even than visits were paid in New
      York thirty years ago; and instantly, without any preface, looking her
      straight in the face, told Mrs. Portico that she was in great trouble and
      must appeal to her for assistance. Georgina had in her aspect no symptom
      of distress; she was as fresh and beautiful as the April day itself; she
      held up her head and smiled, with a sort of familiar bravado, looking like
      a young woman who would naturally be on good terms with fortune. It was
      not in the least in the tone of a person making a confession or relating a
      misadventure that she presently said: &ldquo;Well, you must know, to begin with&mdash;of
      course, it will surprise you&mdash;that I &lsquo;m married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married, Georgina Grossie!&rdquo; Mrs. Portico repeated in her most resonant
      tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgina got up, walked with her majestic step across the room, and closed
      the door. Then she stood there, her back pressed against the mahogany
      panels, indicating only by the distance she had placed between herself and
      her hostess the consciousness of an irregular position. &ldquo;I am not Georgina
      Gressie! I am Georgina Benyon,&mdash;and it has become plain, within a
      short time, that the natural consequence will take place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Portico was altogether bewildered. &ldquo;The natural consequence?&rdquo; she
      exclaimed, staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of one&rsquo;s being married, of course,&mdash;I suppose you know what that is.
      No one must know anything about it. I want you to take me to Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Portico now slowly rose from her place, and approached her visitor,
      looking at her from head to foot as she did so, as if to challenge the
      truth of her remarkable announcement. She rested her hands on Georgina&rsquo;s
      shoulders a moment, gazing into her blooming face, and then she drew her
      closer and kissed her. In this way the girl was conducted back to the
      sofa, where, in a conversation of extreme intimacy, she opened Mrs.
      Portico&rsquo;s eyes wider than they had ever been opened before. She was
      Raymond Benyon&rsquo;s wife; they had been married a year, but no one knew
      anything about it. She had kept it from every one, and she meant to go on
      keeping it. The ceremony had taken place in a little Episcopal church at
      Harlem, one Sunday afternoon, after the service. There was no one in that
      dusty suburb who knew them; the clergyman, vexed at being detained, and
      wanting to go home to tea, had made no trouble; he tied the knot before
      they could turn round. It was ridiculous how easy it had been. Raymond had
      told him frankly that it must all be under the rose, as the young lady&rsquo;s
      family disapproved of what she was doing. But she was of legal age, and
      perfectly free; he could see that for himself. The parson had given a
      grunt as he looked at her over his spectacles. It was not very
      complimentary; it seemed to say that she was indeed no chicken. Of course
      she looked old for a girl; but she was not a girl now, was she? Raymond
      had certified his own identity as an officer in the United States Navy (he
      had papers, besides his uniform, which he wore), and introduced the
      clergyman to a friend he had brought with him, who was also in the navy, a
      venerable paymaster. It was he who gave Georgina away, as it were; he was
      an old, old man, a regular grandmother, and perfectly safe. He had been
      married three times himself. After the ceremony she went back to her
      father&rsquo;s; but she saw Mr. Benyon the next day. After that, she saw him&mdash;for
      a little while&mdash;pretty often. He was always begging her to come to
      him altogether; she must do him that justice. But she wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;she
      wouldn&rsquo;t now&mdash;perhaps she would n&rsquo;t ever. She had her reasons, which
      seemed to her very good, but were very difficult to explain. She would
      tell Mrs. Portico in plenty of time what they were. But that was not the
      question now, whether they were good or bad; the question was for her to
      get away from the country for several months,&mdash;far away from any one
      who had ever known her. She would like to go to some little place in Spain
      or Italy, where she should be out of the world until everything was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Portico&rsquo;s heart gave a jump as this serene, handsome, familiar girl,
      sitting there with a hand in hers, and pouring forth this extraordinary
      tale, spoke of everything being over. There was a glossy coldness in it,
      an unnatural lightness, which suggested&mdash;poor Mrs. Portico scarcely
      knew what. If Georgina was to become a mother, it was to be supposed she
      was to remain a mother. She said there was a beautiful place in Italy&mdash;Genoa&mdash;of
      which Raymond had often spoken&mdash;and where he had been more than once,&mdash;he
      admired it so much; could n&rsquo;t they go there and be quiet for a little
      while? She was asking a great favor,&mdash;that she knew very well; but if
      Mrs. Portico would n&rsquo;t take her, she would find some one who would. They
      had talked of such a journey so often; and, certainly, if Mrs. Portico had
      been willing before, she ought to be much more willing now. The girl
      declared that she must do something,&mdash;go somewhere,&mdash;keep, in
      one way or another, her situation unperceived. There was no use talking to
      her about telling,&mdash;she would rather die than tell. No doubt it
      seemed strange, but she knew what she was about. No one had guessed
      anything yet,&mdash;she had succeeded perfectly in doing what she wished,&mdash;and
      her father and mother believed&mdash;as Mrs. Portico had believed,&mdash;had
      n&rsquo;t she?&mdash;that, any time the last year, Raymond Beuyon was less to
      her than he had been before. Well, so he was; yes, he was. He had gone
      away&mdash;he was off, Heaven knew where&mdash;in the Pacific; she was
      alone, and now she would remain alone. The family believed it was all
      over,&mdash;with his going back to his ship, and other things, and they
      were right: for it <i>was</i> over, or it would be soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Portico, by this time, had grown almost afraid of her young friend;
      <i>she</i> had so little fear, she had even, as it were, so little shame.
      If the good lady had been accustomed to analyzing things a little more,
      she would have said she had so little conscience. She looked at Georgina
      with dilated eyes,&mdash;her visitor was so much the calmer of the two,&mdash;and
      exclaimed, and murmured, and sunk back, and sprung forward, and wiped her
      forehead with her pocket-handkerchief! There were things she didn&rsquo;t
      understand; that they should all have been so deceived, that they should
      have thought Georgina was giving her lover up (they flattered themselves
      she was discouraged, or had grown tired of him), when she was really only
      making it impossible she should belong to any one else. And with this, her
      inconsequence, her capriciousness, her absence of motive, the way she
      contradicted herself, her apparent belief that she could hush up such a
      situation forever! There was nothing shameful in having married poor Mr.
      Benyon, even in a little church at Harlem, and being given away by a
      paymaster. It was much more shameful to be in such a state without being
      prepared to make the proper explanations. And she must have seen very
      little of her husband; she must have given him up&mdash;so far as meeting
      him went&mdash;almost as soon as she had taken him. Had not Mrs. Gressie
      herself told Mrs. Portico (in the preceding October, it must have been)
      that there now would be no need of sending Georgina away, inasmuch as the
      affair with the little navy man&mdash;a project in every way so unsuitable&mdash;had
      quite blown over?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After our marriage I saw him less, I saw him a great deal less,&rdquo; Georgina
      explained; but her explanation only appeared to make the mystery more
      dense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see, in that case, what on earth you married him for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had to be more careful; I wished to appear to have given him up. Of
      course we were really more intimate,&mdash;I saw him differently,&rdquo;
       Georgina said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so! I can&rsquo;t for the life of me see why you were n&rsquo;t
      discovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I can say is we weren&rsquo;t No doubt it&rsquo;s remarkable. We managed very
      well,&mdash;that is, I managed,&mdash;he did n&rsquo;t want to manage at all.
      And then, father and mother are incredibly stupid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Portico exhaled a comprehensive moan, feeling glad, on the whole,
      that she had n&rsquo;t a daughter, while Georgina went on to furnish a few more
      details. Raymond Benyon, in the summer, had been ordered from Brooklyn to
      Charlestown, near Boston, where, as Mrs. Portico perhaps knew, there was
      another navy-yard, in which there was a temporary press of work, requiring
      more oversight He had remained there several months, during which he had
      written to her urgently to come to him, and during which, as well, he had
      received notice that he was to rejoin his ship a little later. Before
      doing so he came back to Brooklyn for a few weeks to wind up his work
      there, and then she had seen him&mdash;well, pretty often. That was the
      best time of all the year that had elapsed since their marriage. It was a
      wonder at home that nothing had then been guessed; because she had really
      been reckless, and Benyon had even tried to force on a disclosure. But
      they <i>were</i> stupid, that was very certain. He had besought her again
      and again to put an end to their false position, but she did n&rsquo;t want it
      any more than she had wanted it before. They had rather a bad parting; in
      fact, for a pair of lovers, it was a very queer parting indeed. He did n&rsquo;t
      know, now, the thing she had come to tell Mrs. Portico. She had not
      written to him. He was on a very long cruise. It might be two years before
      he returned to the United States. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how long he stays away,&rdquo;
       Georgina said, very simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t mentioned why you married him. Perhaps you don&rsquo;t remember,&rdquo;
       Mrs. Portico broke out, with her masculine laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; I loved him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have got over that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Georgina hesitated a moment. &ldquo;Why, no, Mrs. Portico, of course I haven&rsquo;t;
      Raymond&rsquo;s a splendid fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you live with him? You don&rsquo;t explain that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would be the use when he&rsquo;s always away? How can one live with a man
      that spends half his life in the South Seas? If he was n&rsquo;t in the navy it
      would be different; but to go through everything,&mdash;I mean everything
      that making our marriage known would bring upon me,&mdash;the scolding and
      the exposure and the ridicule, the scenes at home,&mdash;to go through it
      all, just for the idea, and yet be alone here, just as I was before,
      without my husband after all,&mdash;with none of the good of him,&rdquo;&mdash;and
      here Georgina looked at her hostess as if with the certitude that such an
      enumeration of inconveniences would touch her effectually,&mdash;&ldquo;really,
      Mrs. Portico, I am bound to say I don&rsquo;t think that would be worth while; I
      haven&rsquo;t the courage for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought you were a coward,&rdquo; said Mrs. Portico.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am not,&mdash;if you will give me time. I am very patient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought that, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marrying changes one,&rdquo; said Georgina, still smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly seems to have had a very peculiar effect upon you. Why don&rsquo;t
      you make him leave the navy, and arrange your life comfortably, like every
      one else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would n&rsquo;t for the world interfere with his prospects&mdash;with his
      promotion. That is sure to come for him, and to come quickly, he has such
      talents. He is devoted to his profession; it would ruin him to leave it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young woman, you are a wonderful creature!&rdquo; Mrs. Portico
      exclaimed, looking at her companion as if she had been in a glass case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So poor Raymond says,&rdquo; Georgina answered, smiling more than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, I should have been very sorry to marry a navy man; but if I
      had married him, I should stick to him, in the face of all the scoldings
      in the universe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what your parents may have been; I know what mine are,&rdquo;,
      Georgina replied, with some dignity. &ldquo;When he&rsquo;s a captain, we shall come
      out of hiding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what shall you do meanwhile? What will you do with your children?
      Where will you hide them? What will you do with this one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Georgina rested her eyes on her lap for a minute; then, raising them, she
      met those of Mrs. Portico. &ldquo;Somewhere in Europe,&rdquo; she said, in her sweet
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Georgina Gressie, you &lsquo;re a monster!&rdquo; the elder lady cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what I am about, and you will help me,&rdquo; the girl went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go and tell your father and mother the whole story,&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      what I will do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not in the least afraid of that, not in the least. You will help me,&mdash;I
      assure you that you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean I will support the child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Georgina broke into a laugh. &ldquo;I do believe you would, if I were to ask
      you! But I won&rsquo;t go so far as that; I have something of my own. All I want
      you to do is to be with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Genoa,&mdash;yes, you have got it all fixed! You say Mr. Benyon is so
      fond of the place. That&rsquo;s all very well; but how will he like his infant
      being deposited there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t like it at all. You see I tell you the whole truth,&rdquo; said
      Georgina, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obliged; it&rsquo;s a pity you keep it all for me! It is in his power,
      then, to make you behave properly. <i>He</i> can publish your marriage if
      you won&rsquo;t; and if he does you will have to acknowledge your child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Publish, Mrs. Portico? How little you know my Raymond! He will never
      break a promise; he will go through fire first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what have you got him to promise?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never to insist on a disclosure against my will; never to claim me openly
      as his wife till I think it is time; never to let any one know what has
      passed between us if I choose to keep it still a secret&mdash;to keep it
      for years&mdash;to keep it forever. Never to do anything in the matter
      himself, but to leave it to me. For this he has given me his solemn word
      of honor. And I know what that means!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Portico, on the sofa, fairly bounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>do</i> know what you are about And Mr. Benyon strikes me as more
      fantastic even than yourself. I never heard of a man taking such an
      imbecile vow. What good can it do him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good? The good it did him was that, it gratified me. At the time he
      took it he would have made any promise under the sun. It was a condition I
      exacted just at the very last, before the marriage took place. There was
      nothing at that moment he would have refused me; there was nothing I could
      n&rsquo;t have made him do. He was in love to that degree&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t want
      to boast,&rdquo; said Georgina, with quiet grandeur. &ldquo;He wanted&mdash;he wanted&mdash;&rdquo;
       she added; but then she paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does n&rsquo;t seem to have wanted much!&rdquo; Mrs. Portico cried, in a tone
      which made Georgina turn to the window, as if it might have reached the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hostess noticed the movement and went on: &ldquo;Oh, my dear, if I ever do
      tell your story, I will tell it so that people will hear it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never will tell it. What I mean is, that Raymond wanted the sanction&mdash;of
      the affair at the church&mdash;because he saw that I would never do
      without it. Therefore, for him, the sooner we had it the better, and, to
      hurry it on, he was ready to take any pledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have got it pat enough,&rdquo; said Mrs. Portico, in homely phrase. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know what you mean by sanctions, or what <i>you</i> wanted of &lsquo;em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Georgina got up, holding rather higher than before that beautiful head
      which, in spite of the embarrassments of this interview, had not yet
      perceptibly abated of its elevation. &ldquo;Would you have liked me to&mdash;to
      not marry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Portico rose also, and, flushed with the agitation of unwonted
      knowledge,&mdash;it was as if she had discovered a skeleton in her
      favorite cupboard,&mdash;faced her young friend for a moment. Then her
      conflicting sentiments resolved themselves into an abrupt question,
      uttered,&mdash;for Mrs. Portico,&mdash;with much solemnity: &ldquo;Georgina
      Gressie, were you really in love with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question suddenly dissipated the girl&rsquo;s strange, studied, wilful
      coldness; she broke out, with a quick flash of passion,&mdash;a passion
      that, for the moment, was predominantly anger, &ldquo;Why else, in Heaven&rsquo;s
      name, should I have done what I have done? Why else should I have married
      him? What under the sun had I to gain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A certain quiver in Georgina&rsquo;s voice, a light in her eye which seemed to
      Mrs. Portico more spontaneous, more human, as she uttered these words,
      caused them to affect her hostess rather less painfully than anything she
      had yet said. She took the girl&rsquo;s hand and emitted indefinite, admonitory
      sounds. &ldquo;Help me, my dear old friend, help me,&rdquo; Georgina continued, in a
      low, pleading tone; and in a moment Mrs. Portico saw that the tears were
      in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;re a queer mixture, my child,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Go straight home to
      your own mother, and tell her everything; that is your best help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are kinder than my mother. You must n&rsquo;t judge her by yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can she do to you? How can she hurt you? We are not living in pagan
      times,&rdquo; said Mrs. Portico, who was seldom so historical &ldquo;Besides, you have
      no reason to speak of your mother&mdash;to think of her, even&mdash;so!
      She would have liked you to marry a man of some property; but she has
      always been a good mother to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this rebuke Georgina suddenly kindled again; she was, indeed, as Mrs.
      Portico had said, a queer mixture. Conscious, evidently, that she could
      not satisfactorily justify her present stiffness, she wheeled round upon a
      grievance which absolved her from self-defence. &ldquo;Why, then, did he make
      that promise, if he loved me? No man who really loved me would have made
      it,&mdash;and no man that was a man, as I understand being a man! He might
      have seen that I only did it to test him,&mdash;to see if he wanted to
      take advantage of being left free himself. It is a proof that he does n&rsquo;t
      love me,&mdash;not as he ought to have done; and in such a case as that a
      woman is n&rsquo;t bound to make sacrifices!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Portico was not a person of a nimble intellect; her mind moved
      vigorously, but heavily; yet she sometimes made happy guesses. She saw
      that Georgia&rsquo;s emotions were partly real and partly fictitious; that, as
      regards this last matter, especially, she was trying to &ldquo;get up&rdquo; a
      resentment, in order to excuse herself. The pretext was absurd, and the
      good lady was struck with its being heartless on the part of her young
      visitor to reproach poor Benyon with a concession on which she had
      insisted, and which could only be a proof of his devotion, inasmuch as he
      left her free while he bound himself. Altogether, Mrs. Portico was shocked
      and dismayed at such a want of simplicity in the behavior of a young
      person whom she had hitherto believed to be as candid as she was elegant,
      and her appreciation of this discovery expressed itself in the
      uncompromising remark: &ldquo;You strike me as a very bad girl, my dear; you
      strike me as a very bad girl!&rdquo;

      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It will doubtless seem to the reader very singular that, in spite of this
      reflection, which appeared to sum up her judgment of the matter, Mrs.
      Portico should, in the course of a very few days, have consented to
      everything that Georgina asked of her. I have thought it well to narrate
      at length the first conversation that took place between them, but I shall
      not trace further the details of the girl&rsquo;s hard pleading, or the steps by
      which&mdash;in the face of a hundred robust and salutary convictions&mdash;the
      loud, kind, sharp, simple, sceptical, credulous woman took under her
      protection a damsel whose obstinacy she could not speak of without getting
      red with anger. It was the simple fact of Georgina&rsquo;s personal condition
      that moved her; this young lady&rsquo;s greatest eloquence was the seriousness
      of her predicament She might be bad, and she had a splendid, careless,
      insolent, fair-faced way of admitting it, which at moments, incoherently,
      inconsistently, and irresistibly, resolved the harsh confession into tears
      of weakness; but Mrs. Portico had known her from her rosiest years, and
      when Georgina declared that she could n&rsquo;t go home, that she wished to be
      with her and not with her mother, that she could n&rsquo;t expose herself,&mdash;how
      could she?&mdash;and that she must remain with her and her only till the
      day they should sail, the poor lady was forced to make that day a reality.
      She was overmastered, she was cajoled, she was, to a certain extent,
      fascinated. She had to accept Georgina&rsquo;s rigidity (she had none of her own
      to oppose to it; she was only violent, she was not continuous), and once
      she did this, it was plain, after all, that to take her young friend to
      Europe was to help her, and to leave her alone was not to help her.
      Georgina literally frightened Mrs. Portico into compliance. She was
      evidently capable of strange things if thrown upon her own devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, from one day to another Mrs. Portico announced that she was really at
      last about to sail for foreign lands (her doctor having told her that if
      she did n&rsquo;t look out she would get too old to enjoy them), and that she
      had invited that robust Miss Gressie, who could stand so long on her feet,
      to accompany her. There was joy in the house of Gressie at this
      announcement, for though the danger was over, it was a great general
      advantage to Georgina to go, and the Gressies were always elated at the
      prospect of an advantage. There was a danger that she might meet Mr.
      Benyon on the other side of the world; but it didn&rsquo;t seem likely that Mrs.
      Portico would lend herself to a plot of that kind. If she had taken it
      into her head to favor their love affair, she would have done it frankly,
      and Georgina would have been married by this time. Her arrangements were
      made as quickly as her decision had been&mdash;or rather had appeared&mdash;slow;
      for this concerned those agile young men down town. Georgina was
      perpetually at her house; it was understood in Twelfth Street that she was
      talking over her future travels with her kind friend. Talk there was, of
      course to a considerable degree; but after it was settled they should
      start nothing more was said about the motive of the journey. Nothing was
      said, that is, till the night before they sailed; then a few words passed
      between them. Georgina had already taken leave of her relations in Twelfth
      Street, and was to sleep at Mrs. Portico&rsquo;s in order to go down to the ship
      at an early hour. The two ladies were sitting together in the firelight,
      silent, with the consciousness of corded luggage, when the elder one
      suddenly remarked to her companion that she seemed to be taking a great
      deal upon herself in assuming that Raymond Benyon wouldn&rsquo;t force her hand.
      <i>He</i> might choose to acknowledge his child, if she didn&rsquo;t; there were
      promises and promises, and many people would consider they had been let
      off when circumstances were so altered. She would have to reckon with Mr.
      Benyon more than she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what I am about,&rdquo; Georgina answered. &ldquo;There is only one promise,
      for him. I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by circumstances being altered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything seems to me to be changed,&rdquo; poor Mrs. Portico murmured, rather
      tragically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he is n&rsquo;t, and he never will! I am sure of him,&mdash;as sure as
      that I sit here. Do you think I would have looked at him if I had n&rsquo;t
      known he was a man of his word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have chosen him well, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Portico, who by this time
      was reduced to a kind of bewildered acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I have chosen him well! In such a matter as this he will be
      perfectly splendid.&rdquo; Then suddenly, &ldquo;Perfectly splendid,&mdash;that&rsquo;s why
      I cared for him!&rdquo; she repeated, with a flash of incongruous passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This seemed to Mrs. Portico audacious to the point of being sublime; but
      she had given up trying to understand anything that the girl might say or
      do. She understood less and less, after they had disembarked in England
      and begun to travel southward; and she understood least of all when, in
      the middle of the winter, the event came off with which, in imagination,
      she had tried to familiarize herself, but which, when it occurred, seemed
      to her beyond measure strange and dreadful. It took place at Genoa, for
      Georgina had made up her mind that there would be more privacy in a big
      town than in a little; and she wrote to America that both Mrs. Portico and
      she had fallen in love with the place and would spend two or three months
      there. At that time people in the United States knew much less than to-day
      about the comparative attractions of foreign cities, and it was not
      thought surprising that absent New Yorkers should wish to linger in a
      seaport where they might find apartments, according to Georgina&rsquo;s report,
      in a palace painted in fresco by Vandyke and Titian. Georgina, in her
      letters, omitted, it will be seen, no detail that could give color to Mrs.
      Portico&rsquo;s long stay at Genoa. In such a palace&mdash;where the travellers
      hired twenty gilded rooms for the most insignificant sum&mdash;a
      remarkably fine boy came into the world. Nothing could have been more
      successful and comfortable than this transaction. Mrs. Portico was almost
      appalled at the facility and felicity of it. She was by this time in a
      pretty bad way, and&mdash;what had never happened to her before in her
      life&mdash;she suffered from chronic depression of spirits. She hated to
      have to lie, and now she was lying all the time. Everything she wrote
      home, everything that had been said or done in connection with their stay
      in Genoa, was a lie. The way they remained indoors to avoid meeting chance
      compatriots was a lie. Compatriots, in Genoa, at that period, were very
      rare; but nothing could exceed the businesslike completeness of Georgina&rsquo;s
      precautions. Her nerves, her self-possession, her apparent want of
      feeling, excited on Mrs. Portico&rsquo;s part a kind of gloomy suspense; a
      morbid anxiety to see how far her companion would go took possession of
      the excellent woman, who, a few months before, hated to fix her mind on
      disagreeable things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgina went very far indeed; she did everything in her power to
      dissimulate the origin of her child. The record of its birth was made
      under a false name, and he was baptized at the nearest church by a
      Catholic priest. A magnificent contadina was brought to light by the
      doctor in a village in the hills, and this big, brown, barbarous creature,
      who, to do her justice, was full of handsome, familiar smiles and coarse
      tenderness, was constituted nurse to Raymond Benyon&rsquo;s son. She nursed him
      for a fortnight under the mother&rsquo;s eye, and she was then sent back to her
      village with the baby in her arms and sundry gold coin knotted into a
      corner of her rude pocket-handkerchief. Mr. Gressie had given his daughter
      a liberal letter of credit on a London banker, and she was able, for the
      present, to make abundant provision for the little one. She called Mrs.
      Portico&rsquo;s attention to the fact that she spent none of her money on
      futilities; she kept it all for her small pensioner in the Genoese hills.
      Mrs. Portico beheld these strange doings with a stupefaction that
      occasionally broke into passionate protest; then she relapsed into a
      brooding sense of having now been an accomplice so far that she must be an
      accomplice to the end. The two ladies went down to Rome&mdash;Georgina was
      in wonderful trim&mdash;to finish the season, and here Mrs. Portico became
      convinced that she intended to abandon her offspring. She had not driven
      into the country to see the nursling before leaving Genoa,&mdash;she had
      said that she could n&rsquo;t bear to see it in such a place and among such
      people. Mrs. Portico, it must be added, had felt the force of this plea,&mdash;felt
      it as regards a plan of her own, given up after being hotly entertained
      for a few hours, of devoting a day, by herself, to a visit to the big
      contadina. It seemed to her that if she should see the child in the sordid
      hands to which Georgina had consigned it she would become still more of a
      participant than she was already. This young woman&rsquo;s blooming hardness,
      after they got to Borne, acted upon her like a kind of Medusa-mask. She
      had seen a horrible thing, she had been mixed up with it, and her motherly
      heart had received a mortal chill. It became more clear to her every day
      that, though Georgina would continue to send the infant money in
      considerable quantities, she had dispossessed herself of it forever.
      Together with this induction a fixed idea settled in her mind,&mdash;the
      project of taking the baby herself, of making him her own, of arranging
      that matter with the father. The countenance she had given Georgina up to
      this point was an effective pledge that she would not expose her; but she
      could adopt the child without exposing her; she could say that he was a
      lovely baby&mdash;he was lovely, fortunately&mdash;whom she had picked up
      in a poor village in Italy,&mdash;a village that had been devastated by
      brigands. She would pretend&mdash;she could pretend; oh, yes, of course,
      she could pretend! Everything was imposture now, and she could go on to
      lie as she had begun. The falsity of the whole business sickened her; it
      made her so yellow that she scarcely knew herself in her glass. None the
      less, to rescue the child, even if she had to become falser still, would
      be in some measure an atonement for the treachery to which she had already
      lent herself. She began to hate Georgina, who had drawn her into such an
      atrocious current, and if it had not been for two considerations she would
      have insisted on their separating. One was the deference she owed to Mr.
      and Mrs. Gressie, who had reposed such a trust in her; the other was that
      she must keep hold of the mother till she had got possession of the infant
      Meanwhile, in this forced communion, her aversion to her companion
      increased; Georgina came to appear to her a creature of brass, of iron;
      she was exceedingly afraid of her, and it seemed to her now a wonder of
      wonders that she should ever have trusted her enough to come so far.
      Georgina showed no consciousness of the change in Mrs. Portico, though
      there was, indeed, at present, not even a pretence of confidence between
      the two. Miss Gressie&mdash;that was another lie, to which Mrs. Portico
      had to lend herself&mdash;was bent on enjoying Europe, and was especially
      delighted with Rome. She certainly had the courage of her undertaking, and
      she confessed to Mrs. Portico that she had left Raymond Benyon, and meant
      to continue to leave him, in ignorance of what had taken place at Genoa.
      There was a certain confidence, it must be said, in that. He was now in
      Chinese waters, and she probably should not see him for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Portico took counsel with herself, and the result of her cogitation
      was, that she wrote to Mr. Benyon that a charming little boy had been born
      to him, and that Georgina had put him to nurse with Italian peasants, but
      that, if he would kindly consent to it, she, Mrs. Portico, would bring him
      up much better than that. She knew not how to address her letter, and
      Georgina, even if <i>she</i> should know, which was doubtful, would never
      tell her; so she sent the missive to the care of the Secretary of the
      Navy, at Washington, with an earnest request that it might immediately be
      forwarded. Such was Mrs. Portico&rsquo;s last effort in this strange business of
      Georgina&rsquo;s. I relate rather a complicated fact in a very few words when I
      say that the poor lady&rsquo;s anxieties, indignations, repentances, preyed upon
      her until they fairly broke her down. Various persons whom she knew in
      Borne notified her that the air of the Seven Hills was plainly unfavorable
      to her, and she had made up her mind to return to her native land, when
      she found that, in her depressed condition, malarial fever had laid its
      hand upon her. She was unable to move, and the matter was settled for her
      in the course of an illness which, happily, was not prolonged. I have said
      that she was not obstinate, and the resistance that she made on the
      present occasion was not worthy even of her spasmodic energy. Brain-fever
      made its appearance, and she died at the end of three weeks, during which
      Georgina&rsquo;s attentions to her patient and protectress had been unremitting.
      There were other Americans in Rome who, after this sad event, extended to
      the bereaved young lady every comfort and hospitality. She had no lack of
      opportunities for returning under a proper escort to New York. She
      selected, you may be sure, the best, and re-entered her father&rsquo;s house,
      where she took to plain dressing; for she sent all her pocket-money, with
      the utmost secrecy, to the little boy in the Genoese hills.

    <h2>
      IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should he come if he doesn&rsquo;t like you? He is under no obligation, and
      he has his ship to look after. Why should he sit for an hour at a time,
      and why should he be so pleasant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he is very pleasant?&rdquo; Kate Theory asked, turning away her
      face from her sister. It was important that Mildred should not see how
      little the expression of that charming countenance corresponded with the
      inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      This precaution was useless, however, for in a moment Mildred said, from
      the delicately draped couch, where she lay at the open window, &ldquo;Kate
      Theory, don&rsquo;t be affected!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s for you he comes. I don&rsquo;t see why he should n&rsquo;t; you are far
      more attractive than I, and you have a great deal more to say. How can he
      help seeing that you are the cleverest of the clever? You can talk to him
      of everything: of the dates of the different eruptions, of the statues and
      bronzes in the Museum, which you have never seen, poor darling! but which
      you know more about than he does, than any one does. What was it you began
      on last time? Oh, yes, you poured forth floods about Magna Græcia. And
      then&mdash;and then&mdash;&rdquo; But with this Kate Theory paused; she felt it
      would n&rsquo;t do to speak the words that had risen to her lips. That her
      sister was as beautiful as a saint, and as delicate and refined as an
      angel,&mdash;she had been on the point of saying something of that sort
      But Mildred&rsquo;s beauty and delicacy were the fairness of mortal disease, and
      to praise her for her refinement was simply to intimate that she had the
      tenuity of a consumptive. So, after she had checked herself, the younger
      girl&mdash;she was younger only by a year or two&mdash;simply kissed her
      tenderly, and settled the knot of the lace handkerchief that was tied over
      her head. Mildred knew what she had been going to say,&mdash;knew why she
      had stopped. Mildred knew everything, without ever leaving her room, or
      leaving, at least, that little salon of their own, at the <i>pension</i>,
      which she had made so pretty by simply lying there, at the window that had
      the view of the bay and of Vesuvius, and telling Kate how to arrange and
      rearrange everything. Since it began to be plain that Mildred must spend
      her small remnant of years altogether in warm climates, the lot of the two
      sisters had been cast in the ungarnished hostelries of southern Europe.
      Their little sitting-room was sure to be very ugly, and Mildred was never
      happy till it was rearranged. Her sister fell to work, as a matter of
      course, the first day, and changed the place of all the tables, sofas,
      chairs, till every combination had been tried, and the invalid thought at
      last that there was a little effect Kate Theory had a taste of her own,
      and her ideas were not always the same as her sister&rsquo;s; but she did
      whatever Mildred liked, and if the poor girl had told her to put the
      doormat on the dining-table, or the clock under the sofa, she would have
      obeyed without a murmur. Her own ideas, her personal tastes, had been
      folded up and put away, like garments out of season, in drawers and
      trunks, with camphor and lavender. They were not, as a general thing, for
      southern wear, however indispensable to comfort in the climate of New
      England, where poor Mildred had lost her health. Kate Theory, ever since
      this event, had lived for her companion, and it was almost an
      inconvenience for her to think that she was attractive to Captain Benyon.
      It was as if she had shut up her house and was not in a position to
      entertain. So long as Mildred should live, her own life was suspended; if
      there should be any time afterwards, perhaps she would take it up again;
      but for the present, in answer to any knock at her door, she could only
      call down from one of her dusty windows that she was not at home. Was it
      really in these terms she should have to dismiss Captain Benyon? If
      Mildred said it was for her he came she must perhaps take upon herself
      such a duty; for, as we have seen, Mildred knew everything, and she must
      therefore be right She knew about the statues in the Museum, about the
      excavations at Pompeii, about the antique splendor of Magna Græcia. She
      always had some instructive volume on the table beside her sofa, and she
      had strength enough to hold the book for half an hour at a time. That was
      about the only strength she had now. The Neapolitan winters had been
      remarkably soft, but after the first month or two she had been obliged to
      give up her little walks in the garden. It lay beneath her window like a
      single enormous bouquet; as early as May, that year, the flowers were so
      dense. None of them, however, had a color so intense as the splendid blue
      of the bay, which filled up all the rest of the view. It would have looked
      painted, if you had not been able to see the little movement of the waves.
      Mildred Theory watched them by the hour, and the breathing crest of the
      volcano, on the other side of Naples, and the great sea-vision of Capri,
      on the horizon, changing its tint while her eyes rested there, and
      wondered what would become of her sister after she was gone. Now that
      Percival was married,&mdash;he was their only brother, and from one day to
      the other was to come down to Naples to show them his new wife, as yet a
      complete stranger, or revealed only in the few letters she had written
      them during her wedding tour,&mdash;now that Percival was to be quite
      taken up, poor Kate&rsquo;s situation would be much more grave. Mildred felt
      that she should be able to judge better, after she should have seen her
      sister-in-law, how much of a home Kate might expect to find with the pair;
      but even if Agnes should prove&mdash;well, more satisfactory than her
      letters, it was a wretched prospect for Kate,&mdash;this living as a mere
      appendage to happier people. Maiden aunts were very well, but being a
      maiden aunt was only a last resource, and Kate&rsquo;s first resources had not
      even been tried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the latter young lady wondered as well,&mdash;wondered in what
      book Mildred had read that Captain Benyon was in love with her. She
      admired him, she thought, but he didn&rsquo;t seem a man that would fall in love
      with one like that She could see that he was on his guard; he would n&rsquo;t
      throw himself away. He thought too much of himself, or at any rate he took
      too good care of himself,&mdash;in the manner of a man to whom something
      had happened which had given him a lesson. Of course what had happened was
      that his heart was buried somewhere,&mdash;in some woman&rsquo;s grave; he had
      loved some beautiful girl,&mdash;much more beautiful, Kate was sure, than
      she, who thought herself small and dark,&mdash;and the maiden had died,
      and his capacity to love had died with her. He loved her memory,&mdash;that
      was the only thing he would care for now. He was quiet, gentle, clever,
      humorous, and very kind in his manner; but if any one save Mildred had
      said to her that if he came three times a week to Posilippo, it was for
      anything but to pass his time (he had told them he didn&rsquo;t know another
      soul in Naples), she would have felt that this was simply the kind of
      thing&mdash;usually so idiotic&mdash;that people always thought it
      necessary to say. It was very easy for him to come; he had the big ship&rsquo;s
      boat, with nothing else to do; and what could be more delightful than to
      be rowed across the bay, under a bright awning, by four brown sailors with
      &ldquo;Louisiana&rdquo; in blue letters on their immaculate white shirts, and in gilt
      letters on their fluttering hat ribbons? The boat came to the steps of the
      garden of the <i>pension</i>, where the orange-trees hung over and made
      vague yellow balls shine back out of the water. Kate Theory knew all about
      that, for Captain Benyon had persuaded her to take a turn in the boat, and
      if they had only had another lady to go with them, he could have conveyed
      her to the ship, and shown her all over it It looked beautiful, just a
      little way off, with the American flag hanging loose in the Italian air.
      They would have another lady when Agnes should arrive; then Percival would
      remain with Mildred while they took this excursion. Mildred had stayed
      alone the day she went in the boat; she had insisted on it, and, of course
      it was really Mildred who had persuaded her; though now that Kate came to
      think of it, Captain Benyon had, in his quiet, waiting way&mdash;he turned
      out to be waiting long after you thought he had let a thing pass&mdash;said
      a good deal about the pleasure it would give him. Of course, everything
      would give pleasure to a man who was so bored. He was keeping the
      &ldquo;Louisiana&rdquo; at Naples, week after week, simply because these were the
      commodore&rsquo;s orders. There was no work to be done there, and his time was
      on his hands; but of course the commodore, who had gone to Constantinople
      with the two other ships, had to be obeyed to the letter, however
      mysterious his motives. It made no difference that he was a fantastic,
      grumbling, arbitrary old commodore; only a good while afterwards it
      occurred to Kate Theory that, for a reserved, correct man, Captain Benyon
      had given her a considerable proof of confidence, in speaking to her in
      these terms of his superior officer. If he looked at all hot when he
      arrived at the <i>pension</i>, she offered him a glass of cold
      &ldquo;orangeade.&rdquo; Mildred thought this an unpleasant drink,&mdash;she called it
      messy; but Kate adored it, and Captain Benyon always accepted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day I speak of, to change the subject, she called her sister&rsquo;s
      attention to the extraordinary sharpness of a zigzagging cloud-shadow, on
      the tinted slope of Vesuvius; but Mildred only remarked in answer that she
      wished her sister would many the captain. It was in this familiar way that
      constant meditation led Miss Theory to speak of him; it shows how
      constantly she thought of him, for, in general, no one was more
      ceremonious than she, and the failure of her health had not caused her to
      relax any form that it was possible to keep up. There was a kind of slim
      erectness, even in the way she lay on her sofa; and she always received
      the doctor as if he were calling for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had better wait till he asks me,&rdquo; Kate Theory said. &ldquo;Dear Milly, if I
      were to do some of the things you wish me to do, I should shock you very
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he would marry you, then. You know there is very little time, if I
      wish to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never see it, Mildred. I don&rsquo;t see why you should take so for
      granted that I would accept him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never meet a man who has so few disagreeable qualities. He is
      probably not enormously rich. I don&rsquo;t know what is the pay of a captain in
      the navy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a relief to find there is something you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Kate Theory
      broke in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when I am gone,&rdquo; her sister went on calmly, &ldquo;when I am gone there
      will be plenty for both of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The younger sister, at this, was silent for a moment; then she exclaimed,
      &ldquo;Mildred, you may be out of health, but I don&rsquo;t see why you should be
      dreadful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that since we have been leading this life we have seen no one we
      liked better,&rdquo; said Milly. When she spoke of the life they were leading&mdash;there
      was always a soft resignation of regret and contempt in the allusion&mdash;she
      meant the southern winters, the foreign climates, the vain experiments,
      the lonely waitings, the wasted hours, the interminable rains, the bad
      food, the pottering, humbugging doctors, the damp <i>pensions</i>, the
      chance encounters, the fitful apparitions, of fellow-travellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should n&rsquo;t you speak for yourself alone? I am glad <i>you</i> like
      him, Mildred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like him, why do you give him orangeade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this inquiry Kate began to laugh, and her sister continued,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you are glad I like him, my dear. If I did n&rsquo;t like him, and
      you did, it would n&rsquo;t be satisfactory at all. I can imagine nothing more
      miserable; I should n&rsquo;t die in any sort of comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate Theory usually checked this sort of allusion&mdash;she was always too
      late&mdash;with a kiss; but on this occasion she added that it was a long
      time since Mildred had tormented her so much as she had done to-day. &ldquo;You
      will make me hate him,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that proves you don&rsquo;t already,&rdquo; Milly rejoined; and it happened
      that almost at this moment they saw, in the golden afternoon, Captain
      Benyon&rsquo;s boat approaching the steps at the end of the garden. He came that
      day, and he came two days later, and he came yet once again after an
      interval equally brief, before Percival Theory arrived, with Mrs.
      Percival, from Borne. He seemed anxious to crowd into these few days, as
      he would have said, a good deal of intercourse with the two remarkably
      nice girls&mdash;or nice women, he hardly knew which to call them&mdash;whom
      in the course of a long, idle, rather tedious detention at Naples, he had
      discovered in the lovely suburb of Posilippo. It was the American consul
      who had put him into relation with them; the sisters had had to sign, in
      the consul&rsquo;s presence, some law-papers, transmitted to them by the man of
      business who looked after their little property in America, and the kindly
      functionary, taking advantage of the pretext (Captain Benyon happened to
      come into the consulate as he was starting, indulgently, to wait upon the
      ladies) to bring together &ldquo;two parties&rdquo; who, as he said, ought to
      appreciate each other, proposed to his fellow-officer in the service of
      the United States that he should go with him as witness of the little
      ceremony. He might, of course, take his clerk, but the captain would do
      much better; and he represented to Benyon that the Miss Theorys (singular
      name, wa&rsquo; n&rsquo;t it?) suffered&mdash;he was sure&mdash;from a lack of
      society; also that one of them was very sick, that they were real pleasant
      and extraordinarily refined, and that the sight of a compatriot, literally
      draped, as it were, in the national banner, would cheer them up more than
      most anything, and give them a sense of protection. They had talked to the
      consul about Benyon&rsquo;s ship, which they could see from their windows, in
      the distance, at its anchorage. They were the only American ladies then at
      Naples,&mdash;the only residents, at least,&mdash;and the captain would
      n&rsquo;t be doing the polite thing unless he went to pay them his respects.
      Benyon felt afresh how little it was in his line to call upon strange
      women; he was not in the habit of hunting up female acquaintance, or of
      looking out for the soft emotions which the sex only can inspire. He had
      his reasons for this abstention, and he seldom relaxed it; but the consul
      appealed to him on rather strong grounds; and he suffered himself to be
      persuaded. He was far from regretting, during the first weeks at least, an
      act which was distinctly inconsistent with his great rule,&mdash;that of
      never exposing himself to the chance of seriously caring for an unmarried
      woman. He had been obliged to make this rule, and had adhered to it with
      some success. He was fond of women, but he was forced to restrict himself
      to superficial sentiments. There was no use tumbling into situations from
      which the only possible issue was a retreat The step he had taken with
      regard to poor Miss Theory and her delightful little sister was an
      exception on which at first he could only congratulate himself. That had
      been a happy idea of the ruminating old consul; it made Captain Benyon
      forgive him his hat, his boots, his shirtfront,&mdash;a costume which
      might be considered representative, and the effect of which was to make
      the observer turn with rapture to a half-naked lazzarone. On either side
      the acquaintance had helped the time to pass, and the hours he spent at
      the little <i>pension</i> at Posilippo left a sweet&mdash;and by no means
      innutritive&mdash;taste behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the weeks went by his exception had grown to look a good deal like a
      rule; but he was able to remind himself that the path of retreat was
      always open to him. Moreover, if he should fall in love with the younger
      girl there would be no great harm, for Kate Theory was in love only with
      her sister, and it would matter very little to her whether he advanced or
      retreated. She was very attractive, or rather very attracting. Small,
      pale, attentive without rigidity, full of pretty curves and quick
      movements, she looked as if the habit of watching and serving had taken
      complete possession of her, and was literally a little sister of charity.
      Her thick black hair was pushed behind her ears, as if to help her to
      listen, and her clear brown eyes had the smile of a person too full of
      tact to cany a dull face to a sickbed. She spoke in an encouraging voice,
      and had soothing and unselfish habits. She was very pretty,&mdash;producing
      a cheerful effect of contrasted black and white, and dressed herself
      daintily, so that Mildred might have something agreeable to look at Benyon
      very soon perceived that there was a fund of good service in her. Her
      sister had it all now; but poor Miss Theory was fading fast, and then what
      would become of this precious little force? The answer to such a question
      that seemed most to the point was that it was none of his business. He was
      not sick,&mdash;at least not physically,&mdash;and he was not looking out
      for a nurse. Such a companion might be a luxury, but was not, as yet, a
      necessity: The welcome of the two ladies, at first, had been simple, and
      he scarcely knew what to call it but sweet; a bright, gentle friendliness
      remained the tone of their greeting. They evidently liked him to come,&mdash;they
      liked to see his big transatlantic ship hover about those gleaming coasts
      of exile. The fact of Miss Mildred being always stretched on her couch&mdash;in
      his successive visits to foreign waters Benyon had not unlearned (as why
      should he?) the pleasant American habit of using the lady&rsquo;s personal name&mdash;made
      their intimacy seem greater, their differences less; it was as if his
      hostesses had taken him into their confidence and he had been&mdash;as the
      consul would have said&mdash;of the same party. Knocking about the salt
      parts of the globe, with a few feet square on a rolling frigate for his
      only home, the pretty, flower-decked sitting-room of the quiet American
      sisters became, more than anything he had hitherto known, his interior. He
      had dreamed once of having an interior, but the dream had vanished in
      lurid smoke, and no such vision had come to him again. He had a feeling
      that the end of this was drawing nigh; he was sure that the advent of the
      strange brother, whose wife was certain to be disagreeable, would make a
      difference. That is why, as I have said, he came as often as possible the
      last week, after he had learned the day on which Percival Theory would
      arrive. The limits of the exception had been reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been new to the young ladies at Posilippo, and there was no reason
      why they should say to each other that he was a very different man from
      the ingenuous youth who, ten years before, used to wander with Georgina
      Gressie down vistas of plank fences brushed over with the advertisements
      of quack medicines. It was natural he should be, and we, who know him,
      would have found that he had traversed the whole scale of alteration.
      There was nothing ingenuous in him now; he had the look of experience, of
      having been seasoned and hardened by the years.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face, his complexion, were the same; still smooth-shaven and slim, he
      always passed, at first, for a man scarcely out of his twenties. But his
      expression was old, and his talk was older still,&mdash;the talk of one
      who had seen much of the world (as indeed he had, to-day), and judged most
      things for himself, with a humorous scepticism which, whatever concessions
      it might make, superficially, for the sake of not offending (for instance)
      two remarkably nice American women, of the kind that had kept most of
      their illusions, left you with the conviction that the next minute it
      would go quickly back to its own standpoint There was a curious
      contradiction in him; he struck you as serious, and yet he could not be
      said to take things seriously. This was what made Kate Theory feel so sure
      that he had lost the object of his affections; and she said to herself
      that it must have been under circumstances of peculiar sadness, for that
      was, after all, a frequent accident, and was not usually thought, in
      itself, a sufficient stroke to make a man a cynic. This reflection, it may
      be added, was, on the young lady&rsquo;s part, just the least bit acrimonious.
      Captain Benyon was not a cynic in any sense in which he might have shocked
      an innocent mind; he kept his cynicism to himself, and was a very clever,
      courteous, attentive gentleman. If he was melancholy, you knew it chiefly
      by his jokes, for they were usually at his own expense; and if he was
      indifferent, it was all the more to his credit that he should have exerted
      himself to entertain his countrywomen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last time he called before the arrival of the expected brother, he
      found Miss Theory alone, and sitting up, for a wonder, at her window. Kate
      had driven into Naples to give orders at the hotel for the reception of
      the travellers, who required accommodation more spacious than the villa at
      Posilippo (where the two sisters had the best rooms) could offer them; and
      the sick girl had taken advantage of her absence and of the pretext
      afforded by a day of delicious warmth, to transfer herself, for the first
      time in six months, to an arm-chair. She was practising, as she said, for
      the long carriage-journey to the north, where, in a quiet corner they knew
      of, on the Lago Maggiore, her summer was to be spent. Eaymond Benyon
      remarked to her that she had evidently turned the corner and was going to
      get well, and this gave her a chance to say various things that were on
      her mind. She had many things on her mind, poor Mildred Theory, so caged
      and restless, and yet so resigned and patient as she was; with a clear,
      quick spirit, in the most perfect health, ever reaching forward, to the
      end of its tense little chain, from her wasted and suffering body; and, in
      the course of the perfect summer afternoon, as she sat there, exhilarated
      by the success of her effort to get up, and by her comfortable
      opportunity, she took her friendly visitor into the confidence of most of
      her anxieties. She told him, very promptly and positively, that she was
      not going to get well at all, that she had probably not more than ten
      months yet to live, and that he would oblige her very much by not forcing
      her to waste any more breath in contradicting him on that point. Of course
      she could n&rsquo;t talk much; therefore, she wished to say to him only things
      that he would not hear from any one else. Such, for instance, was her
      present secret&mdash;Katie&rsquo;s and hers&mdash;the secret of their fearing so
      much that they should n&rsquo;t like Percival&rsquo;s wife, who was not from Boston,
      but from New York. Naturally, that by itself would be nothing, but from
      what they had heard of her set&mdash;this subject had been explored by
      their correspondents&mdash;they were rather nervous, nervous to the point
      of not being in the least reassured by the fact that the young lady would
      bring Percival a fortune. The fortune was a matter of course, for that was
      just what they had heard about Agnes&rsquo;s circle&mdash;that the stamp of
      money was on all their thoughts and doings. They were very rich and very
      new and very splashing, and evidently had very little in common with the
      two Miss Theorys, who, moreover, if the truth must be told (and this was a
      great secret), did not care much for the letters their sister-in-law had
      hitherto addressed them. She had been at a French boarding-school in New
      York, and yet (and this was the greatest secret of all) she wrote to them
      that she had performed a part of the journey through France in <i>diligance!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, they would see the next day; Miss Mildred was sure she should
      know in a moment whether Agnes would like them. She could never have told
      him all this if her sister had been there, and Captain Benyon must promise
      never to reveal to Kate how she had chattered. Kate thought always that
      they must hide everything, and that even if Agnes should be a dreadful
      disappointment they must never let any one guess it And yet Kate was just
      the one who would suffer, in the coming years, after she herself had gone.
      Their brother had been everything to them, but now it would all be
      different Of course it was not to be expected that he should have remained
      a bachelor for their sake; she only wished he had waited till she was dead
      and Kate was married One of these events, it was true, was much less sure
      than the other; Kate might never marry,&mdash;much as she wished she
      would! She was quite morbidly unselfish, and did n&rsquo;t think she had a right
      to have anything of her own&mdash;not even a husband. Miss Mildred talked
      a good while about Kate, and it never occurred to her that she might bore
      Captain Benyon. She did n&rsquo;t, in point of fact; he had none of the trouble
      of wondering why this poor, sick, worried lady was trying to push her
      sister down his throat Their peculiar situation made everything natural,
      and the tone she took with him now seemed only what their pleasant
      relation for the last three months led up to. Moreover, he had an
      excellent reason for not being bored: the fact, namely, that after all,
      with regard to her sister, Miss Mildred appeared to him to keep back more
      than she uttered. She didn&rsquo;t tell him the great thing,&mdash;she had
      nothing to say as to what that charming girl thought of Eaymond Benyon.
      The effect of their interview, indeed, was to make him shrink from
      knowing, and he felt that the right thing for him would be to get back
      into his boat, which was waiting at the garden steps, before Kate Theory
      should return from Naples. It came over him, as he sat there, that he was
      far too interested in knowing what this young lady thought of him. She
      might think what she pleased; it could make no difference to him. The best
      opinion in the world&mdash;if it looked out at him from her tender eyes&mdash;would
      not make him a whit more free or more happy. Women of that sort were not
      for him, women whom one could not see familiarly without falling in love
      with them, and whom it was no use to fall in love with unless one was
      ready to marry them. The light of the summer afternoon, and of Miss
      Mildred&rsquo;s pure spirit, seemed suddenly to flood the whole subject. He saw
      that he was in danger, and he had long since made up his mind that from
      this particular peril it was not only necessary but honorable to flee. He
      took leave of his hostess before her sister reappeared, and had the
      courage even to say to her that he would not come back often after that;
      they would be so much occupied by their brother and his wife! As he moved
      across the glassy bay, to the rhythm of the oars, he wished either that
      the sisters would leave Naples or that his confounded commodore would send
      for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Kate returned from her errand, ten minutes later, Milly told her of
      the captain&rsquo;s visit, and added that she had never seen anything so sudden
      as the way he left her. &ldquo;He would n&rsquo;t wait for you, my dear, and he said
      he thought it more than likely that he should never see us again. It is as
      if he thought you were going to die too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is his ship called away?&rdquo; Kate Theory asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did n&rsquo;t tell me so; he said we should be so busy with Percival and
      Agnes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has got tired of us,&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. There&rsquo;s nothing wonderful in
      that; I knew he would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mildred said nothing for a moment; she was watching her sister, who was
      very attentively arranging some flowers. &ldquo;Yes, of course, we are very
      dull, and he is like everybody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you thought he was so wonderful,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;and so fond of
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is; I am surer of that than ever. That&rsquo;s why he went away so
      abruptly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate looked at her sister now. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither do I, darling. But you will, one of these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How if he never comes back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he will&mdash;after a while&mdash;when I am gone. Then he will
      explain; that, at least, is clear to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor precious, as if I cared!&rdquo; Kate Theory exclaimed, smiling as she
      distributed her flowers. She carried them to the window, to place them
      near her sister, and here she paused a moment, her eye caught by an
      object, far out in the bay, with which she was not unfamiliar. Mildred
      noticed its momentary look, and followed its direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the captain&rsquo;s gig going back to the ship,&rdquo; Milly said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so
      still one can almost hear the oars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate Theory turned away, with a sudden, strange violence, a movement and
      exclamation which, the very next minute, as she became conscious of what
      she had said,&mdash;and, still more, of what she felt&mdash;smote her own
      heart (as it flushed her face) with surprise, and with the force of a
      revelation: &ldquo;I wish it would sink him to the bottom of the sea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her sister stared, then caught her by the dress, as she passed from her,
      drawing her back with a weak hand. &ldquo;Oh, my dearest, my poorest!&rdquo; And she
      pulled Kate down and down toward her, so that the girl had nothing for it
      but to sink on her knees and bury her face in Mildred&rsquo;s lap. If that
      ingenious invalid did not know everything now, she knew a great deal.

      V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Percival proved very pretty. It is more gracious to begin with this
      declaration, instead of saying that, in the first place, she proved very
      silly. It took a long day to arrive at the end of her silliness, and the
      two ladies at Posilippo, even after a week had passed, suspected that they
      had only skirted its edges. Kate Theory had not spent half an hour in her
      company before she gave a little private sigh of relief; she felt that a
      situation which had promised to be embarrassing was now quite clear, was
      even of a primitive simplicity. She would spend with her sister-in-law, in
      the coming time, one week in the year; that was all that was mortally
      possible. It was a blessing that one could see exactly what she was, for
      in that way the question settled itself. It would have been much more
      tiresome if Agnes had been a little less obvious; then she would have had
      to hesitate and consider and weigh one thing against another. She was
      pretty and silly, as distinctly as an orange is yellow and round; and Kate
      Theory would as soon have thought of looking to her to give interest to
      the future as she would have thought of looking to an orange to impart
      solidity to the prospect of dinner. Mrs. Percival travelled in the hope of
      meeting her American acquaintance, or of making acquaintance with such
      Americans as she did meet, and for the purpose of buying mementos for her
      relations. She was perpetually adding to her store of articles in
      tortoise-shell, in mother-of-pearl, in olive-wood, in ivory, in filigree,
      in tartan lacquer, in mosaic; and she had a collection of Roman scarfs and
      Venetian beads, which she looked over exhaustively every night before she
      went to bed. Her conversation bore mainly upon the manner in which she
      intended to dispose of these accumulations. She was constantly changing
      about, among each other, the persons to whom they were respectively to be
      offered. At Borne one of the first things she said to her husband after
      entering the Coliseum had been: &ldquo;I guess I will give the ivory work-box to
      Bessie and the Roman pearls to Aunt Harriet!&rdquo; She was always hanging over
      the travellers&rsquo; book at the hotel; she had it brought up to her, with a
      cup of chocolate, as soon as she arrived. She searched its pages for the
      magical name of New York, and she indulged in infinite conjecture as to
      who the people were&mdash;the name was sometimes only a partial cue&mdash;who
      had inscribed it there. What she most missed in Europe, and what she most
      enjoyed, were the New Yorkers; when she met them she talked about the
      people in their native city who had &ldquo;moved&rdquo; and the streets they had moved
      to. &ldquo;Oh, yes, the Drapers are going up town, to Twenty-fourth Street, and
      the Vanderdeckens are going to be in Twenty-third Street, right back of
      them. My uncle, Henry Piatt, thinks of building round there.&rdquo; Mrs.
      Percival Theory was capable of repeating statements like these thirty
      times over,&mdash;of lingering on them for hours. She talked largely of
      herself, of her uncles and aunts, of her clothes&mdash;past, present, and
      future. These articles, in especial, filled her horizon; she considered
      them with a complacency which might have led you to suppose that she had
      invented the custom of draping the human form. Her main point of contact
      with Naples was the purchase of coral; and all the while she was there the
      word &ldquo;set&rdquo;&mdash;she used it as if every one would understand&mdash;fell
      with its little, flat, common sound upon the ears of her sisters-in-law,
      who had no sets of anything. She cared little for pictures and mountains;
      Alps and Apennines were not productive of New Yorkers, and it was
      difficult to take an interest in Madonnas who flourished at periods when,
      apparently, there were no fashions, or, at any rate, no trimmings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I speak here not only of the impression she made upon her husband&rsquo;s
      anxious sisters, but of the judgment passed on her (he went so far as
      that, though it was not obvious how it mattered to him) by Raymond Benyon.
      And this brings me at a jump (I confess it&rsquo;s a very small one) to the fact
      that he did, after all, go back to Posilippo. He stayed away for nine
      days, and at the end of this time Percival Theory called upon him, to
      thank him for the civility he had shown his kinswomen. He went to this
      gentleman&rsquo;s hotel, to return his visit, and there he found Miss Kate, in
      her brother&rsquo;s sitting-room. She had come in by appointment from the villa,
      and was going with the others to seek the royal palace, which she had not
      yet had an opportunity to inspect It was proposed (not by Kate), and
      presently arranged, that Captain Benyon should go with them, and he
      accordingly walked over marble floors for half an hour, exchanging
      conscious commonplaces with the woman he loved. For this truth had rounded
      itself during those nine days of absence; he discovered that there was
      nothing particularly sweet in his life when once Kate Theory had been
      excluded from it He had stayed away to keep himself from falling in love
      with her; but this expedient was in itself illuminating, for he perceived
      that, according to the vulgar adage, he was locking the stable door after
      the horse had been stolen. As he paced the deck of his ship and looked
      toward Posilippo, his tenderness crystallized; the thick, smoky flame of a
      sentiment that knew itself forbidden and was angry at the knowledge, now
      danced upon the fuel of his good resolutions. The latter, it must be said,
      resisted, declined to be consumed. He determined that he would see Kate
      Theory again, for a time, just sufficient to bid her good-by, and to add a
      little explanation. He thought of his explanation very lovingly, but it
      may not strike the reader as a happy inspiration. To part from her dryly,
      abruptly, without an allusion to what he might have said if everything had
      been different,&mdash;that would be wisdom, of course, that would be virtue,
      that would be the line of a practical man, of a man who kept himself well
      in hand. But it would be virtue terribly unrewarded,&mdash;it would be
      virtue too austere for a person who sometimes flattered himself that he
      had taught himself stoicism. The minor luxury tempted him irresistibly,
      since the larger&mdash;that of happy love&mdash;was denied him; the luxury
      of letting the girl know that it would not be an accident&mdash;oh, not at
      all&mdash;that they should never meet again. She might easily think it
      was, and thinking it was would doubtless do her no harm. But this would
      n&rsquo;t give him his pleasure,&mdash;the Platonic satisfaction of expressing
      to her at the same time his belief that they might have made each other
      happy, and the necessity of his renunciation. That, probably, wouldn&rsquo;t
      hurt her either, for she had given him no proof whatever that she cared
      for him. The nearest approach to it was the way she walked beside him now,
      sweet and silent, without the least reference to his not having been back
      to the villa. The place was cool and dusky, the blinds were drawn, to keep
      out the light and noise, and the little party wandered through the high
      saloons, where precious marbles and the gleam of gilding and satin made
      reflections in the rich dimness. Here and there the cicerone, in slippers,
      with Neapolitan familiarity, threw open a shutter to show off a picture on
      a tapestry. He strolled in front with Percival Theory and his wife, while
      this lady, drooping silently from her husband&rsquo;s arm as they passed, felt
      the stuff of the curtains and the sofas. When he caught her in these
      experiments, the cicerone, in expressive deprecation, clasped his hands
      and lifted his eyebrows; whereupon Mrs. Theory exclaimed to her husband,
      &ldquo;Oh, bother his old king!&rdquo; It was not striking to Captain Benyon why
      Percival Theory had married the niece of Mr. Henry Piatt. He was less
      interesting than his sisters,&mdash;a smooth, cool, correct young man, who
      frequently took out a pencil and did a little arithmetic on the back of a
      letter. He sometimes, in spite of his correctness, chewed a toothpick, and
      he missed the American papers, which he used to ask for in the most
      unlikely places. He was a Bostonian converted to New York; a very special
      type.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it settled when you leave Naples?&rdquo; Benyon asked of Kate Theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so; on the twenty-fourth. My brother has been very kind; he has
      lent us his carriage, which is a large one, so that Mildred can lie down.
      He and Agnes will take another; but, of course, we shall travel together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to Heaven I were going with you?&rdquo; Captain Benyon said. He had
      given her the opportunity to respond, but she did not take it; she merely
      remarked, with a vague laugh, that of course he couldn&rsquo;t take his ship
      over the Apennines. &ldquo;Yes, there is always my ship,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I am
      afraid that in future it will carry me far away from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were alone in one of the royal apartments; their companions had
      passed, in advance of them, into the adjoining room. Benyon and his
      fellow-visitor had paused beneath one of the immense chandeliers of glass,
      which in the clear, colored gloom (through it one felt the strong outer
      light of Italy beating in) suspended its twinkling drops from the
      decorated vault. They looked round them confusedly, made shy for the
      moment by Benyon&rsquo;s having struck a note more serious than any that had
      hitherto souuded between them, looked at the sparse furniture, draped in
      white overalls, at the scagiiola floor, in which the great cluster of
      crystal pendants seemed to shine again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are master of your ship. Can&rsquo;t you sail it as you like?&rdquo; Kate Theory
      asked, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not master of anything. There is not a man in the world less free. I
      am a slave. I am a victim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with kind eyes; something in his voice suddenly made her
      put away all thought of the defensive airs that a girl, in certain
      situations, is expected to assume. She perceived that he wanted to make
      her understand something, and now her only wish was to help him to say it.
      &ldquo;You are not happy,&rdquo; she murmured, simply, her voice dying away in a kind
      of wonderment at this reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentle touch of the words&mdash;it was as if her hand had stroked his
      cheek&mdash;seemed to him the sweetest thing he had ever known. &ldquo;No, I am
      not happy, because I am not free. If I were&mdash;if I were, I would give
      up my ship. I would give up everything, to follow you. I can&rsquo;t explain;
      that is part of the hardness of it. I only want you to know it,&mdash;that
      if certain things were different, if everything was different, I might
      tell you that I believe I should have a right to speak to you. Perhaps
      some day it will change; but probably then it will be too late. Meanwhile,
      I have no right of any kind. I don&rsquo;t want to trouble you, and I don&rsquo;t ask
      of you&mdash;anything! It is only to have spoken just once. I don&rsquo;t make
      you understand, of course. I am afraid I seem to you rather a brute,&mdash;perhaps
      even a humbug. Don&rsquo;t think of it now,&mdash;don&rsquo;t try to understand. But
      some day, in the future, remember what I have said to you, and how we
      stood here, in this strange old place, alone! Perhaps it will give you a
      little pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate Theory began by listening to him with visible eagerness; but in a
      moment she turned away her eyes. &ldquo;I am very sorry for you,&rdquo; she said,
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you do understand enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall think of what you have said, in the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benyon&rsquo;s lips formed the beginning of a word of tenderness, which he
      instantly suppressed; and in a different tone, with a bitter smile and a
      sad shake of the head, raising his arms a moment and letting them fall, he
      said: &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t hurt any one, your remembering this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whom you mean.&rdquo; And the girl, abruptly, began to walk to the
      end of the room. He made no attempt to tell her whom he meant, and they
      proceeded together in silence till they overtook their companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were several pictures in the neighboring room, and Percival Theory
      and his wife had stopped to look at one of them, of which the cicerone
      announced the title and the authorship as Benyon came up. It was a modern
      portrait of a Bourbon princess, a woman young, fair, handsome, covered
      with jewels. Mrs. Percival appeared to be more struck with it than with
      anything the palace had yet offered to her sight, while her sister-in-law
      walked to the window, which the custodian had opened, to look out into the
      garden. Benyon noticed this; he was conscious that he had given the girl
      something to reflect upon, and his ears burned a little as he stood beside
      Mrs. Percival and looked up, mechanically, at the royal lady. He already
      repented a little of what he had said, for, after all, what was the use?
      And he hoped the others wouldn&rsquo;t observe that he had been making love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious, Percival! Do you see who she looks like?&rdquo; Mrs. Theory said to
      her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looks like a woman who has run up a big bill at Tiffany&rsquo;s,&rdquo; this
      gentleman answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looks like my sister-in-law; the eyes, the mouth, the way the hair&rsquo;s
      done,&mdash;the whole thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which do you mean? You have got about a dozen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Georgina, of course,&mdash;Georgina Roy. She&rsquo;s awfully like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call <i>her</i> your sister-in-law?&rdquo; Percival Theory asked. &ldquo;You
      must want very much to claim her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s handsome enough. You have got to invent some new name, then.
      Captain Benyon, what do you call your brother-in-law&rsquo;s second wife?&rdquo; Mrs.
      Percival continued, turning to her neighbor, who still stood staring at
      the portrait. At first he had looked without seeing; then sight, and
      hearing as well, became quick. They were suddenly peopled with thrilling
      recognitions. The Bourbon princess&mdash;the eyes, the mouth, the way the
      hair was done; these things took on an identity, and the gaze of the
      painted face seemed to fasten itself to his own. But who in the world was
      Georgina Roy, and what was this talk about sisters-in-law? He turned to
      the little lady at his side a countenance unexpectedly puzzled by the
      problem she had airily presented to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother-in-law&rsquo;s second wife? That&rsquo;s rather complicated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course, he need n&rsquo;t have married again?&rdquo; said Mrs. Percival,
      with a small sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom did he marry?&rdquo; asked Benyon, staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percival Theory had turned away. &ldquo;Oh, if you are going into her
      relationships!&rdquo; he murmured, and joined his sister at the brilliant
      window, through which, from the distance, the many-voiced uproar of Naples
      came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He married first my sister Dora, and she died five years ago. Then he
      married <i>her</i>,&rdquo; and Mrs. Percival nodded at the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benyon&rsquo;s eyes went back to the portrait; he could see what she meant&mdash;it
      stared out at him. &ldquo;Her? Georgina?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Georgina Gressie. Gracious, do you know her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was very distinct&mdash;that answer of Mrs. Percival&rsquo;s, and the
      question that followed it as well. But he had the resource of the picture;
      he could look at it, seem to take it very seriously, though it danced up
      and down before him. He felt that he was turning red, then he felt that he
      was turning pale. &ldquo;The brazen impudence!&rdquo; That was the way he could speak
      to himself now of the woman he had once loved, and whom he afterwards
      hated, till this had died out, too. Then the wonder of it was lost in the
      quickly growing sense that it would make a difference for him,&mdash;a
      great difference. Exactly what, he didn&rsquo;t see yet; only a difference that
      swelled and swelled as he thought of it, and caught up, in its expansion,
      the girl who stood behind him so quietly, looking into the Italian garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The custodian drew Mrs. Percival away to show her another princess, before
      Benyon answered her last inquiry. This gave him time to recover from his
      first impulse, which had been to answer it with a negative; he saw in a
      moment that an admission of his acquaintance with Mrs. Roy (Mrs. Roy!&mdash;it
      was prodigious!) was necessarily helping him to learn more. Besides, it
      needn&rsquo;t be compromising. Very likely Mrs. Percival would hear one day that
      he had once wanted to marry her. So, when he joined his companions a
      minute later he remarked that he had known Miss Gressie years before, and
      had even admired her considerably, but had lost sight of her entirely in
      later days. She had been a great beauty, and it was a wonder that she had
      not married earlier. Five years ago, was it? No, it was only two. He had
      been going to say that in so long a time it would have been singular he
      should not have heard of it. He had been away from New York for ages; but
      one always heard of marriages and deaths. This was a proof, though two
      years was rather long. He led Mrs. Percival insidiously into a further
      room, in advance of the others, to whom the cicerone returned. She was
      delighted to talk about her &ldquo;connections,&rdquo; and she supplied him with every
      detail He could trust himself now; his self-possession was complete, or,
      so far as it was wanting, the fault was that of a sudden gayety which he
      could not, on the spot, have accounted for. Of course it was not very
      flattering to them&mdash;Mrs. Percivals own people&mdash;that poor Dora&rsquo;s
      husband should have consoled himself; but men always did it (talk of
      widows!) and he had chosen a girl who was&mdash;well, very fine-looking,
      and the sort of successor to Dora that they needn&rsquo;t be ashamed of. She had
      been awfully admired, and no one had understood why she had waited so long
      to marry. She had had some affair as a girl,&mdash;an engagement to an
      officer in the army,&mdash;and the man had jilted her, or they had
      quarrelled, or something or other. She was almost an old maid,&mdash;well,
      she was thirty, or very nearly,&mdash;but she had done something good now.
      She was handsomer than ever, and tremendously stylish. William Roy had one
      of the biggest incomes in the city, and he was quite affectionate. He had
      been intensely fond of Dora&mdash;he often spoke of her still, at least to
      her own relations; and her portrait, the last time Mrs. Percival was in
      his house (it was at a party, after his marriage to Miss Gressie), was
      still in the front parlor.. Perhaps by this time he had had it moved to
      the back; but she was sure he would keep it somewhere, anyway. Poor Dora
      had had no children; but Georgina was making that all right,&mdash;she had
      a beautiful boy. Mrs. Percival had what she would have called quite a
      pleasant chat with Captain Benyon about Mrs. Roy. Perhaps <i>he</i> was
      the officer&mdash;she never thought of that? He was sure he had never
      jilted her? And he had never quarrelled with a lady? Well, he must be
      different from most men.
    </p>
    <p>
      He certainly had the air of being so, before he parted that afternoon with
      Kate Theory. This young lady, at least, was free to think him wanting in
      that consistency which is supposed to be a distinctively masculine virtue.
      An hour before, he had taken an eternal farewell of her, and now he was
      alluding to future meetings, to future visits, proposing that, with her
      sister-in-law, she should appoint an early day for coming to see the
      &ldquo;Louisiana.&rdquo; She had supposed she understood him, but it would appear now
      that she had not understood him at all. His manner had changed, too. More
      and more off his guard, Raymond Benyon was not aware how much more hopeful
      an expression it gave him, his irresistible sense that somehow or other
      this extraordinary proceeding of his wife&rsquo;s would set him free. Kate
      Theory felt rather weary and mystified,&mdash;all the more for knowing
      that henceforth Captain Benyon&rsquo;s variations would be the most important
      thing in life for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This officer, on his ship in the bay, lingered very late on deck that
      night,&mdash;lingered there, indeed, under the warm southern sky, in which
      the stars glittered with a hot, red light, until the early dawn began to
      show. He smoked cigar after cigar, he walked up and down by the hour, he
      was agitated by a thousand reflections, he repeated to himself that it
      made a difference,&mdash;an immense difference; but the pink light had
      deepened in the east before he had discovered in what the diversity
      consisted. By that time he saw it clearly,&mdash;it consisted in
      Georgina&rsquo;s being in his power now, in place of his being in hers. He
      laughed as he sat there alone in the darkness at the thought of what she
      had done. It had occurred to him more than once that she would do it,&mdash;he
      believed her capable of anything; but the accomplished fact had a
      freshness of comicality. He thought of Mr. William Roy, of his big income,
      of his being &ldquo;quite affectionate,&rdquo; of his blooming son and heir, of his
      having found such a worthy successor to poor Mrs. Dora. He wondered
      whether Georgina had happened to mention to him that she had a husband
      living, but was strongly of the belief that she had not. Why should she,
      after all? She had neglected to mention it to so many others. He had
      thought he knew her, in so many years,&mdash;that he had nothing more to
      learn about her; but this ripe stroke revived his sense of her audacity.
      Of course it was what she had been waiting for, and if she had not done it
      sooner it was because she had hoped he would be lost at sea in one of his
      long cruises and relieve her of the necessity of a crime. How she must
      hate him to-day for not having been lost, for being alive, for continuing
      to put her in the wrong! Much as she hated him, however, his own loathing
      was at least a match for hers. She had done him the foulest of wrongs,&mdash;she
      had ravaged his life. That he should ever detest in this degree a woman
      whom he had once loved as he loved her, he would not have thought possible
      in his innocent younger years. But he would not have thought it possible
      then that a woman should be such a cold-blooded devil as she had been. His
      love had perished in his rage,&mdash;his blinding, impotent rage at
      finding that he had been duped, and measuring his impotence. When he
      learned, years before, from Mrs. Portico, what she had done with her baby,
      of whose entrance into life she herself had given him no intimation, he
      felt that he was face to face with a full revelation of her nature. Before
      that it had puzzled him; it had amazed him; his relations with her were
      bewildering, stupefying. But when, after obtaining, with difficulty and
      delay, a leave of absence from Government, and betaking himself to Italy
      to look for the child and assume possession of it, he had encountered
      absolute failure and defeat,&mdash;then the case presented itself to him
      more simply. He perceived that he had mated himself with a creature who
      just happened to be a monster, a human exception altogether. That was what
      he could n&rsquo;t pardon&mdash;her conduct about the child; never, never,
      never! To him she might have done what she chose,&mdash;dropped him,
      pushed him out into eternal cold, with his hands fast tied,&mdash;and he
      would have accepted it, excused her almost, admitted that it had been his
      business to mind better what he was about. But she had tortured him
      through the poor little irrecoverable son whom he had never seen, through
      the heart and the vitals that she had not herself, and that he had to
      have, poor wretch, for both of them!
    </p>
    <p>
      All his efforts for years had been to forget these horrible months, and he
      had cut himself off from them so that they seemed at times to belong to
      the life of another person. But to-night he lived them over again; he
      retraced the different gradations of darkness through which he had passed,
      from the moment, so soon after his extraordinary marriage, when it came
      over him that she already repented, and meant, if possible, to elude all
      her obligations. This was the moment when he saw why she had reserved
      herself&mdash;in the strange vow she extracted from him&mdash;an open door
      for retreat; the moment, too, when her having had such an inspiration (in
      the midst of her momentary good faith, if good faith it had ever been)
      struck him as a proof of her essential depravity. What he had tried to
      forget came back to him: the child that was not his child produced for him
      when he fell upon that squalid nest of peasants in the Genoese country;
      and then the confessions, retractations, contradictions, lies, terrors,
      threats, and general bottomless, baffling baseness of every one in the
      place. The child was gone; that had been the only definite thing. The
      woman who had taken it to nurse had a dozen different stories,&mdash;her
      husband had as many,&mdash;and every one in the village had a hundred
      more. Georgina had been sending money,&mdash;she had managed, apparently,
      to send a good deal,&mdash;and the whole country seemed to have been
      living on it and making merry. At one moment the baby had died and
      received a most expensive burial; at another he had been intrusted (for
      more healthy air, Santissima Madonna!) to the woman&rsquo;s cousin in another
      village. According to a version, which for a day or two Benyon had
      inclined to think the least false, he had been taken by the cousin (for
      his beauty&rsquo;s sake) to Genoa (when she went for the first time in her life
      to the town to see her daughter in service there), and had been confided
      for a few hours to a third woman, who was to keep him while the cousin
      walked about the streets, but who, having no child of her own, took such a
      fancy to him that she refused to give him up, and a few days later left
      the place (she was a Pisana) never to be heard of more. The cousin had
      forgotten her name,&mdash;it had happened six months before. Benyon spent
      a year looking up and down Italy for his child, and inspecting hundreds of
      swaddled infants, impenetrable candidates for recognition. Of course he
      could only get further and further from real knowledge, and his search was
      arrested by the conviction that it was making him mad. He set his teeth
      and made up his mind (or tried to) that the baby had died in the hands of
      its nurse. This was, after all, much the likeliest supposition, and the
      woman had maintained it, in the hope of being rewarded for her candor,
      quite as often as she had asseverated that it was still, somewhere, alive,
      in the hope of being remunerated for her good news. It may be imagined
      with what sentiments toward his wife Benyon had emerged from this episode.
      To-night his memory went further back,&mdash;back to the beginning and to
      the days when he had had to ask himself, with all the crudity of his first
      surprise, what in the name of wantonness she had wished to do with him.
      The answer to this speculation was so old,&mdash;it had dropped so ont of
      the line of recurrence,&mdash;that it was now almost new again. Moreover,
      it was only approximate, for, as I have already said, he could comprehend
      such conduct as little at the end as at the beginning. She had found
      herself on a slope which her nature forced her to descend to the bottom.
      She did him the honor of wishing to enjoy his society, and she did herself
      the honor of thinking that their intimacy&mdash;however brief&mdash;must
      have a certain consecration. She felt that, with him, after his promise
      (he would have made any promise to lead her on), she was secure,&mdash;secure
      as she had proved to be, secure as she must think herself now. That
      security had helped her to ask herself, after the first flush of passion
      was over, and her native, her twice-inherited worldliness had bad time to
      open its eyes again, why she should keep faith with a man whose
      deficiencies (as a husband before the world&mdash;another affair) had been
      so scientifically exposed to her by her parents. So she had simply
      determined not to keep faith; and her determination, at least, she did
      keep.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time Benyon turned in he had satisfied himself, as I say, that
      Georgina was now in his power; and this seemed to him such an improvement
      in his situation that he allowed himself (for the next ten days) a license
      which made Kate Theory almost as happy as it made her sister, though she
      pretended to understand it far less. Mildred sank to her rest, or rose to
      fuller comprehensions, within the year, in the Isle of Wight, and Captain
      Benyon, who had never written so many letters as since they left Naples,
      sailed westward about the same time as the sweet survivor. For the
      &ldquo;Louisiana&rdquo; at last was ordered home.

      Certainly, I will see you if you come, and you may appoint any day or hour
      you like. I should have seen you with pleasure any time these last years.
      Why should we not be friends, as we used to be? Perhaps we shall be yet. I
      say &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; only, on purpose,&mdash;because your note is rather vague
      about your state of mind. Don&rsquo;t come with any idea about making me nervous
      or uncomfortable. I am not nervous by nature, thank Heaven, and I won&rsquo;t&mdash;I
      positively won&rsquo;t (do you hear, dear Captain Benyon?)&mdash;be
      uncomfortable. I have been so (it served me right) for years and years;
      but I am very happy now. To remain so is the very definite intention of,
      yours ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgina Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the answer Benyon received to a short letter that he despatched
      to Mrs. Roy after his return to America. It was not till he had been there
      some weeks that he wrote to her. He had been occupied in various ways: he
      had had to look after his ship; he had had to report at Washington; he had
      spent a fortnight with his mother at Portsmouth, N. H.; and he had paid a
      visit to Kate Theory in Boston. She herself was paying visits, she was
      staying with various relatives and friends. She had more color&mdash;it
      was very delicately rosy&mdash;than she had had of old, in spite of her
      black dress; and the effect of looking at him seemed to him to make her
      eyes grow still prettier. Though sisterless now, she was not without
      duties, and Benyon could easily see that life would press hard on her
      unless some one should interfere. Every one regarded her as just the
      person to do certain things. Every one thought she could do everything,
      because she had nothing else to do. She used to read to the blind, and,
      more onerously, to the deaf. She looked after other people&rsquo;s children
      while the parents attended anti-slavery conventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was coming to New York later to spend a week at her brother&rsquo;s, but
      beyond this she didn&rsquo;t know what she should do. Benyon felt it to be
      awkward that he should not be able, just now, to tell her; and this had
      much to do with his coming to the point, for he accused himself of having
      rather hung fire. Coming to the point, for Benyon, meant writing a note to
      Mrs. Roy (as he must call her), in which he asked whether she would see
      him if he should present himself. The missive was short; it contained, in
      addition to what I have noted, little more than the remark that he had
      something of importance to say to her. Her reply, which we have just read,
      was prompt. Benyon designated an hour, and the next day rang the doorbell
      of her big modern house, whose polished windows seemed to shine defiance
      at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood on the steps, looking up and down the straight vista of the
      Fifth Avenue, he perceived that he was trembling a little, that <i>he</i>
      was nervous, if she was not. He was ashamed of his agitation, and he
      addressed himself a very stern reprimand. Afterwards he saw that what had
      made him nervous was not any doubt of the goodness of his cause, but his
      revived sense (as he drew near her) of his wife&rsquo;s hardness,&mdash;her
      capacity for insolence. He might only break himself against that, and the
      prospect made him feel helpless. She kept him waiting for a long time
      after he had been introduced; and as he walked up and down her
      drawing-room, an immense, florid, expensive apartment, covered with blue
      satin, gilding, mirrors and bad frescos, it came over him as a certainty
      that her delay was calculated. She wished to annoy him, to weary him; she
      was as ungenerous as she was unscrupulous. It never occurred to him that
      in spite of the bold words of her note, she, too, might be in a tremor,
      and if any one in their secret bad suggested that she was afraid to meet
      him, he would have laughed at this idea. This was of bad omen for the
      success of his errand; for it showed that he recognized the ground of her
      presumption,&mdash;his having the superstition of old promises. By the
      time she appeared, he was flushed,&mdash;very angry. She closed the door
      behind her, and stood there looking at him, with the width of the room
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first emotion her presence excited was a quick sense of the strange
      fact that, after all these years of loneliness, such a magnificent person
      should be his wife. For she was magnificent, in the maturity of her
      beauty, her head erect, her complexion splendid, her auburn tresses
      undimmed, a certain plenitude in her very glance. He saw in a moment that
      she wished to seem to him beautiful, she had endeavored to dress herself
      to the best effect. Perhaps, after all, it was only for this she had
      delayed; she wished to give herself every possible touch. For some moments
      they said nothing; they had not stood face to face for nearly ten years,
      and they met now as adversaries. No two persons could possibly be more
      interested in taking each other&rsquo;s measure. It scarcely belonged to
      Georgina, however, to have too much the air of timidity; and after a
      moment, satisfied, apparently, that she was not to receive a broadside,
      she advanced, slowly rubbing her jewelled hands and smiling. He wondered
      why she should smile, what thought was in her mind. His impressions
      followed each other with extraordinary quickness of pulse, and now he saw,
      in addition to what he had already perceived, that she was waiting to take
      her cue,&mdash;she had determined on no definite line. There was nothing
      definite about her but her courage; the rest would depend upon him. As for
      her courage, it seemed to glow in the beauty which grew greater as she
      came nearer, with her eyes on his and her fixed smile; to be expressed in
      the very perfume that accompanied her steps. By this time he had got still
      a further impression, and it was the strangest of all. She was ready for
      anything, she was capable of anything, she wished to surprise him with her
      beauty, to remind him that it belonged, after all, at the bottom of
      everything, to him. She was ready to bribe him, if bribing should be
      necessary. She had carried on an intrigue before she was twenty; it would
      be more, rather than less, easy for her, now that she was thirty. All this
      and more was in her cold, living eyes, as in the prolonged silence they
      engaged themselves with his; but I must not dwell upon it, for reasons
      extraneous to the remarkable fact She was a truly amazing creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raymond!&rdquo; she said, in a low voice, a voice which might represent either
      a vague greeting or an appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took no heed of the exclamation, but asked her why she had deliberately
      kept him waiting,&mdash;as if she had not made a fool enough of him
      already. She could n&rsquo;t suppose it was for his pleasure he had come into
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated a moment,&mdash;still with her smile. &ldquo;I must tell you I
      have a son,&mdash;the dearest little boy. His nurse happened to be engaged
      for the moment, and I had to watch him. I am more devoted to him than you
      might suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fell back from her a few steps. &ldquo;I wonder if you are insane,&rdquo; he
      murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To allude to my child? Why do you ask me such questions then? I tell you
      the simple truth. I take every care of this one. I am older and wiser. The
      other one was a complete mistake; he had no right to exist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you kill him then with your own hands, instead of that
      torture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did n&rsquo;t I kill myself? That question would be more to the point You
      are looking wonderfully well,&rdquo; she broke off in another tone; &ldquo;had n&rsquo;t we
      better sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t come here for the advantage of conversation,&rdquo; Benyon answered.
      And he was going on, but she interrupted him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came to say something dreadful, very likely; though I hoped you would
      see it was better not But just tell me this before you begin. Are you
      successful, are you happy? It has been so provoking, not knowing more
      about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something in the manner in which this was said that caused him
      to break into a loud laugh; whereupon she added,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your laugh is just what it used to be. How it comes back to me! You <i>have</i>
      improved in appearance,&rdquo; she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had seated herself, though he remained standing; and she leaned back
      in a low, deep chair, looking up at him, with her arms folded. He stood
      near her and over her, as it were, dropping his baffled eyes on her, with
      his hand resting on the corner of the chimney-piece. &ldquo;Has it never
      occurred to you that I may deem myself absolved from the promise made you
      before I married you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very often, of course. But I have instantly dismissed the idea. How can
      you be &lsquo;absolved&rsquo;? One promises, or one doesn&rsquo;t. I attach no meaning to
      that, and neither do you.&rdquo; And she glanced down to the front of her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benyon listened, but he went on as if he had not heard her. &ldquo;What I came
      to say to you is this: that I should like your consent to my bringing a
      suit for divorce against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A suit for divorce? I never thought of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that I may marry another woman. I can easily obtain a divorce on the
      ground of your desertion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stared a moment, then her smile solidified, as it were, and she looked
      grave; but he could see that her gravity, with her lifted eyebrows, was
      partly assumed. &ldquo;Ah, you want to marry another woman!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
      slowly, thoughtfully. He said nothing, and she went on: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do
      as I have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t want my children to be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before he could say the words she sprang up, checking him with a cry.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it; it is n&rsquo;t necessary! Of course I know what you mean; but
      they won&rsquo;t be if no one knows it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should object to knowing it myself; it&rsquo;s enough for me to know it of
      yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I have been prepared for your saying that&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope so!&rdquo; Benyon exclaimed. &ldquo;You may be a bigamist if it suits
      you, but to me the idea is not attractive. I wish to marry&mdash;&rdquo; and,
      hesitating a moment, with his slight stammer, he repeated, &ldquo;I wish to
      marry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry, then, and have done with it!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could already see that he should be able to extract no consent from
      her; he felt rather sick. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s extraordinary to me that you should n&rsquo;t be
      more afraid of being found out,&rdquo; he said after a moment&rsquo;s reflection.
      &ldquo;There are two or three possible accidents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know how much afraid I am? I have thought of every accident,
      in dreadful nights. How do you know what my life is, or what it has been
      all these miserable years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look wasted and worn, certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t compliment me!&rdquo; Georgina exclaimed. &ldquo;If I had never known you&mdash;if
      I had not been through all this&mdash;I believe I should have been
      handsome. When did you hear of my marriage? Where were you at the time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Naples, more than six months ago, by a mere chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange that it should have taken you so long! Is the lady a
      Neapolitan? They don&rsquo;t mind what they do over there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no information to give you beyond what I just said,&rdquo; Benyon
      rejoined. &ldquo;My life does n&rsquo;t in the least regard you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but it does from the moment I refuse to let you divorce me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refuse?&rdquo; Benyon said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me that way! You have n&rsquo;t advanced so rapidly as I used to
      think you would; you haven&rsquo;t distinguished yourself so much,&rdquo; she went on,
      irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be promoted commodore one of these days,&rdquo; Benyon answered. &ldquo;You
      don&rsquo;t know much about it, for my advancement has already been very
      exceptionally rapid.&rdquo; He blushed as soon as the words were out of his
      mouth. She gave a light laugh on seeing it; but he took up his hat and
      added: &ldquo;Think over a day or two what I have proposed to you. Think of the
      temper in which I ask it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The temper?&rdquo; she stared. &ldquo;Pray, what have you to do with temper?&rdquo; And as
      he made no reply, smoothing his hat with his glove, she went on: &ldquo;Years
      ago, as much as you please I you had a good right, I don&rsquo;t deny, and you
      raved, in your letters, to your heart&rsquo;s content That&rsquo;s why I would n&rsquo;t see
      you; I did n&rsquo;t wish to take it full in the face. But that&rsquo;s all over now,
      time is a healer, you have cooled off, and by your own admission you have
      consoled yourself. Why do you talk to me about temper! What in the world
      have I done to you, but let you alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you call this business?&rdquo; Benyon asked, with his eye flashing all
      over the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, excuse me, that doesn&rsquo;t touch you,&mdash;it&rsquo;s my affair. I leave you
      your liberty, and I can live as I like. If I choose to live in this way,
      it may be queer (I admit it is, awfully), but you have nothing to say to
      it. If I am willing to take the risk, you may be. If I am willing to play
      such an infernal trick upon a confiding gentleman (I will put it as
      strongly as you possibly could), I don&rsquo;t see what you have to say to it
      except that you are tremendously glad such a woman as that is n&rsquo;t known to
      be your wife!&rdquo; She had been cool and deliberate up to this time; but with
      these words her latent agitation broke out &ldquo;Do you think I have been
      happy? Do you think I have enjoyed existence? Do you see me freezing up
      into a stark old maid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder you stood out so long!&rdquo; said Benyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder I did. They were bad years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt they were!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could do as you pleased,&rdquo; Georgina went on. &ldquo;You roamed about the
      world; you formed charming relations. I am delighted to hear it from your
      own lips. Think of my going back to my father&rsquo;s house&mdash;that family
      vault&mdash;and living there, year after year, as Miss Gressie! If you
      remember my father and mother&mdash;they are round in Twelfth Street, just
      the same&mdash;you must admit that I paid for my folly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never understood you; I don&rsquo;t understand you now,&rdquo; said Benyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him a moment. &ldquo;I adored you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could damn you with a word!&rdquo; he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he had spoken she grasped his arm and held up her other hand,
      as if she were listening to a sound outside the room. She had evidently
      had an inspiration, and she carried it into instant effect She swept away
      to the door, flung it open, and passed into the hall, whence her voice
      came back to Benyon as she addressed a person who was apparently her
      husband. She had heard him enter the house at his habitual hour, after his
      long morning at business; the closing of the door of the vestibule had
      struck her ear. The parlor was on a level with the hall, and she greeted
      him without impediment. She asked him to come in and be introduced to
      Captain Benyon, and he responded with due solemnity. She returned in
      advance of him, her eyes fixed upon Benyon and lighted with defiance, her
      whole face saying to him, vividly: &ldquo;Here is your opportunity; I give it to
      you with my own hands. Break your promise and betray me if you dare! You
      say you can damn me with a word: speak the word and let us see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benyon&rsquo;s heart beat faster, as he felt that it was indeed a chance; but
      half his emotion came from the spectacle&mdash;magnificent in its way&mdash;of
      her unparalleled impudence. A sense of all that he had escaped in not
      having had to live with her rolled over him like a wave, while he looked
      strangely at Mr. Roy, to whom this privilege had been vouchsafed. He saw
      in a moment his successor had a constitution that would carry it. Mr. Roy
      suggested squareness and solidity; he was a broadbased, comfortable,
      polished man, with a surface in which the rank tendrils of irritation
      would not easily obtain a foothold. He had a broad, blank face, a
      capacious mouth, and a small, light eye, to which, as he entered, he was
      engaged in adjusting a double gold-rimmed glass. He approached Benyon with
      a prudent, civil, punctual air, as if he habitually met a good many
      gentlemen in the course of business, and though, naturally, this was not
      that sort of occasion he was not a man to waste time in preliminaries.
      Benyon had immediately the impression of having seen him&mdash;or his
      equivalent&mdash;a thousand times before. He was middle-aged,
      fresh-colored, whiskered, prosperous, indefinite. Georgina introduced them
      to each other. She spoke of Benyon as an old friend whom she had known
      long before she had known Mr. Roy, who had been very kind to her years
      ago, when she was a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the navy. He has just come back from a long cruise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoy shook hands,&mdash;Benyon gave him his before he knew it,&mdash;said
      he was very happy, smiled, looked at Benyon from head to foot, then at
      Georgina, then round the room, then back at Benyon again,&mdash;at Benyon,
      who stood there, without sound or movement, with a dilated eye, and a
      pulse quickened to a degree of which Mr. Roy could have little idea.
      Georgina made some remark about their sitting down, but William Roy
      replied that he had n&rsquo;t time for that,&mdash;if Captain Benyon would
      excuse him. He should have to go straight into the library, and write a
      note to send back to his office, where, as he just remembered, he had
      neglected to give, in leaving the place, an important direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can wait a moment, surely,&rdquo; Georgina said. &ldquo;Captain Benyon wants so
      much to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, my dear; I can wait a minute, and I can come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benyon saw, accordingly, that he was waiting, and that Georgina was
      waiting too. Each was waiting for him to say something, though they were
      waiting for different things. Mr. Roy put his hands behind him, balanced
      himself on his toes, hoped that Captain Benyon had enjoyed his cruise,&mdash;though
      he should n&rsquo;t care much for the navy himself,&mdash;and evidently wondered
      at the stolidity of his wife&rsquo;s visitor. Benyon knew he was speaking, for
      he indulged in two or three more observations, after which he stopped. But
      his meaning was not present to our hero. This personage was conscious of
      only one thing, of his own momentary power,&mdash;of everything that hung
      on his lips; all the rest swam before him; there was vagueness in his ears
      and eyes. Mr. Roy stopped, as I say, and there was a pause, which seemed
      to Benyon of tremendous length. He knew, while it lasted, that Georgina
      was as conscious as himself that he felt his opportunity, that he held it
      there in his hand, weighing it noiselessly in the palm, and that she
      braved and scorned, or, rather, that she enjoyed, the danger. He asked
      himself whether he should be able to speak if he were to try, and then he
      knew that he should not, that the words would stick in his throat, that he
      should make sounds that would dishonor his cause. There was no real choice
      or decision, then, on Benyon&rsquo;s part; his silence was after all the same
      old silence, the fruit of other hours and places, the stillness to which
      Georgina listened, while he felt her eager eyes fairly eat into his face,
      so that his cheeks burned with the touch of them. The moments stood before
      him in their turn; each one was distinct. &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; said Mr. Roy,
      &ldquo;perhaps I interrupt,&mdash;I &lsquo;ll just dash off my note&rdquo; Benyon knew that
      he was rather bewildered, that he was making a pretext, that he was
      leaving the room; knew presently that Georgina again stood before him
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are exactly the man I thought you!&rdquo; she announced, as joyously as if
      she had won a bet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the most horrible woman I can imagine. Good God! if I <i>had</i>
      had to live with you!&rdquo; That is what he said to her in answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even at this she never flushed; she continued to smile in triumph. &ldquo;He
      adores me&mdash;but what&rsquo;s that to you? Of course you have all the
      future,&rdquo; she went on; &ldquo;but I know you as if I had made you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benyon reflected a moment &ldquo;If he adores you, you are all right. If our
      divorce is pronounced, you will be free, and then he can marry you
      properly, which he would like ever so much better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too touching to hear you reason about it. Fancy me telling such a
      hideous story&mdash;about myself&mdash;me&mdash;<i>me</i>!&rdquo; And she
      touched her breasts with her white fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benyon gave her a look that was charged with all the sickness of his
      helpless rage. &ldquo;You&mdash;<i>you</i>!&rdquo; he repeated, as he turned away from
      her and passed through the door which Mr. Roy had left open.
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed him into the hall, she was close behind him; he moved before
      her as she pressed. &ldquo;There was one more reason,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I would n&rsquo;t be
      forbidden. It was my hideous pride. That&rsquo;s what prevents me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what it is,&rdquo; Benyon answered, wearily, with his hand on the
      knob of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid hers on his shoulder; he stood there an instant feeling it,
      wishing that her loathsome touch gave him the right to strike her to the
      earth,&mdash;to strike her so that she should never rise again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How clever you are, and intelligent always,&mdash;as you used to be; to
      feel so perfectly and know so well, without more scenes, that it&rsquo;s
      hopeless&mdash;my ever consenting! If I have, with you, the shame of
      having made you promise, let me at least have the profit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His back had been turned to her, but at this he glanced round. &ldquo;To hear
      you talk of shame&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what I have gone through; but, of course, I don&rsquo;t ask any
      pity from you. Only I should like to say something kind to you before we
      part I admire you, esteem you: I don&rsquo;t many people! Who will ever tell
      her, if you don&rsquo;t? How will she ever know, then? She will be as safe as I
      am. You know what that is,&rdquo; said Georgina, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had opened the door while she spoke, apparently not heeding her,
      thinking only of getting away from her forever. In reality he heard every
      word she said, and felt to his marrow the lowered, suggestive tone in
      which she made him that last recommendation. Outside, on the steps&mdash;she
      stood there in the doorway&mdash;he gave her his last look. &ldquo;I only hope
      you will die. I shall pray for that!&rdquo; And he descended into the street and
      took his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after this that his real temptation came. Not the temptation to
      return betrayal for betrayal; that passed away even in a few days, for he
      simply knew that he couldn&rsquo;t break his promise, that it imposed itself on
      him as stubbornly as the color of his eyes or the stammer of his lips; it
      had gone forth into the world to live for itself, and was far beyond his
      reach or his authority. But the temptation to go through the form of a
      marriage with Kate Theory, to let her suppose that he was as free as
      herself, and that their children, if they should have any, would, before
      the law, have a right to exist,&mdash;this attractive idea held him fast
      for many weeks, and caused him to pass some haggard nights and days. It
      was perfectly possible she might learn his secret, and that, as no one
      could either suspect it or have an interest in bringing it to light, they
      both might live and die in security and honor. This vision fascinated him;
      it was, I say, a real temptation. He thought of other solutions,&mdash;of
      telling her that he was married (without telling her to whom), and
      inducing her to overlook such an accident, and content herself with a
      ceremony in which the world would see no flaw. But after all the
      contortions of his spirit it remained as clear to him as before that
      dishonor was in everything but renunciation. So, at last, he renounced. He
      took two steps which attested ths act to himself. He addressed an urgent
      request to the Secretary of the Navy that he might, with as little delay
      as possible, be despatched on another long voyage; and he returned to
      Boston to tell Kate Theory that they must wait. He could explain so little
      that, say what he would, he was aware that he could not make his conduct
      seem natural, and he saw that the girl only trusted him,&mdash;that she
      never understood. She trusted without understanding, and she agreed to
      wait. When the writer of these pages last heard of the pair they were
      waiting still.
